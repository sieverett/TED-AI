#TED #TEDTalks #IsraelHamasWar","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'Israel', 'Hamas', 'Gaza']",2023-10-09T17:27:44-07:00,2023-10-09T17:27:44-07:00,News & Politics,"Helen Walters: Hello, everybody. Two days ago, on October 7, the Palestinian Sunni-Islamic
fundamentalist organization Hamas attacked Israel,
overrunning two military bases, occupying territory, killing hundreds of Israeli citizens
and taking dozens more as hostages. It was the most significant
breach of Israel's borders since the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The attacks were clearly
long- and well-planned, and they sent shock waves of fear
and panic through the region and the world. Obviously, it's two days later. It is way too soon to understand
all of the ramifications of these attacks. But we can try to understand
how we got here and the implications of this awful moment. So we asked our community
to share their questions and to answer them,
I am joined by Ian Bremmer, president and founder
of political risk research and consulting firm Eurasia Group. Hi Ian. Ian Bremmer: Helen, great to be with you. HW: Alright, so let's get right to it. We've had a number of our community
who really want you to explain the very simple question
of how we got here. So can you share the historical
context for this moment? And if you like, give us
a bit of a Gaza 101. IB: Well, I mean, Gaza,
we've got a population, a Palestinian population
of just over two million, 2.2 million, exceedingly poor. And, you know, without sovereignty,
without statehood, and a part of the Palestinian
occupied territories, also the West Bank,
more people, 3.5 million. The West Bank run not very well
by the Palestinian Authority, which recognizes Israel's right to exist. Gaza, run really badly,
with very little resources, run by Hamas, which does not recognize
Israel's right to exist. Now we've been talking about a two-state
solution for a very long time. For the idea that the only way
you end up with stability between the Israelis and the Palestinians is if the Palestinians have some ability
to govern themselves, have some control
over their economic trajectory, over their foreign policy,
over their borders. That is not where we stand right now. And indeed, the idea of a two-state solution
has kind of lost the collective interest, imagination, traction, for two reasons. First, because the Middle
East has moved on. A bunch of countries around the region have found that they are interested
in developing direct relations, some formal, some informal, with Israel, and that they're willing to do that irrespective of resolving
the Palestinian question, the Palestinian problem. And we've seen that
with the Abraham Accords under the Trump administration, where the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco all directly
established diplomatic relations with Israel. If you go to Dubai or Abu Dhabi today, you will see Israeli tourists
like you wouldn't imagine. And they’re having a great time
and they’re spending money and they're taking in the sites and they're very welcomed by the Emirates. Unimaginable that was going
to happen 10 or 20 years ago. In fact, Saudi Arabia was very close, not within weeks, it wasn't imminent, but certainly within months
of signing a deal with Israel that would allow for them
to open diplomatic relations. And there's already been a number of high-level diplomatic
relations informally between Mohammed bin Salman
and Prime Minister Netanyahu. So, in other words, across the region,
you had Israel, frankly, in the strongest geopolitical position
that they've been in decades. They've been surrounded by enemies. Well, now they're increasingly surrounded
by countries they can do business with. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, there was an announcement of a deal where the United Arab Emirates
was investing massively into solar power for Jordan, which would then be given to Israel in return for desalinized water
processed by Israel. Even five years ago, inconceivable
a deal like that could happen. So the Israelis, technologically
very sophisticated, an advanced industrial economy, are only standing to make more money by doing business
with all of these countries. What's been happening
with the Palestinians? Nothing. The answer is nothing. They're not benefiting economically. And all of these deals for Israel
have happened without any consequences, any contingencies for the Palestinians. And indeed in Israel, you know, there have been
a lot of headlines. Israel's made a lot of news this year,
but not because of the Palestinians. Israel has made news because of their own
domestic constitutional crisis, an effort by the Prime Minister,
Netanyahu, and his right-wing coalition
to engage in judicial reform, an Israeli judiciary
which is very independent, which has, in the context of democracies, a very surprising amount
of authority over making but also interpretation of laws in Israel. What can and what cannot be considered
a reasonable law to be executed. And for a country
that doesn't have a constitution, not surprising perhaps,
the judiciary is so powerful. And Netanyahu facing corruption charges and with a very weak right-wing coalition
relying on far right, extremist right party
as part of that coalition, was pushing for these reforms. Now, why am I talking about that? Because for the last six months, there have been unprecedented
demonstrations across Israel, peaceful demonstrations, but bringing out the entire country. Because they were concerned
about a constitutional crisis. Kind of an irony for a country
without a constitution. If Netanyahu persisted, went ahead with these reforms. No one was talking about the Palestinians. And indeed, large numbers of troops
that had been in the south were moved to the West Bank as the Netanyahu government was expanding
the settlements in that territory and responding to Palestinian reprisals
against those settlements. So they weren't focused on the issue. They took their eyes off the ball. Israel had other priorities, and the Palestinians were in a position
not only to lose their friends around the region but also increasingly an afterthought
for the Israeli government and the Israeli people. That is the backdrop
for where we are today. HW: So let's dig in a little bit
into the idea that you bring up of the kind of the troubles
that have been roiling Netanyahu and the Israeli government themselves. So I think one of the things
that has been brought up is the massive failure of intelligence
and defense systems in Israel that allowed this attack to happen. What happens next? Do you see Israel uniting
around Netanyahu? Do you see this fracturing even worse
with anger at what happened in the lapses in defense
and intelligence insights? Or what happens next? IB: Well, the first point I should make is just for everyone to understand
what has just happened to the Israeli consciousness. It is unimaginable that, you know, certainly someone
in a developed country could have any understanding of what the Jewish people in Israel
are presently going through. This feeling that, you know,
after the Holocaust and, you know, the land being provided to them
to have a safe haven to create an independent Israeli state. And the need to defend their borders, the historic fights
they've had with their neighbors, the war in 1973, when a number of Arab nations
decided to fight against them. And, you know, the continual
sense of besiegement with missiles from Hezbollah,
for example, terrorist operations. This is not like a bolt from the blue when the United States
experienced 9/11. Israel’s 9/11 is both massively greater
in the impact on Israel but also comes for a country
that was supposed to be prepared for this. I mean, Israel represents
the gold standard on border security around the world. Not like the United States,
where you've got, you know, all sorts of people running across and ""build the wall""
becomes a clarion call precisely because nobody understands
how to defend the border, no. And also, intelligence collection,
surveillance, digital surveillance, human intelligence collection
on the ground, especially in the occupied territories. This is what they do. And the fact is that right now, today, Netanyahu's legacy will not be anything
that he has done to date. It will be this failure
and how he responds to it. Period, end of story. Nothing else is close. So what that means for Israel is that all of the issues
that have roiled this country over the past year, all of the political polarization, and it's not a two-party country, it’s a many, many-party country. You know, the joke is you get
three people together in Israel and, you know, you form
a new political party. And if you go to
the coffeehouses and the rest, everybody's talking politics. Everyone reads the newspapers. This is a highly politically literate
and divided population. But as of right now, priority one, two and three
for the entire Israeli people is to respond to these attacks,
these terrorist attacks. And how are they going to respond to them? Well, number one, they've got to find a way
to get their people back. There are 100-plus, and we don't know
the exact numbers right now, hostages that are being held in Gaza,
most of whom are civilians. And they will do everything
to get them back. And they may well have direct American
support in trying to accomplish that. And then it will be to go into Gaza, to remove the leadership of Gaza, to disarm the militias
in the territory of Gaza, and to do everything they can
to try to ensure that this cannot happen again. And making that happen
is a very, very tall order. It might be a taller order
than the Israelis can accomplish, and certainly the knock-on consequences
will be grave even for just Gaza. And that is before we talk
about any potential expansion of the war. But for now, the Israeli people
will stand together. And there's already talk of a government
of national emergency that would bring together Netanyahu
with the leader of the Israeli opposition for the purposes of fighting this war so that everyone in Israel
is together collectively, ensuring the national security
of the people of Israel. And I think that for the course
of the coming months, and let us remember, this is not just, you know, an attack
against Israel and now they respond. It is very likely
there are Hamas operatives on the ground inside Israel right now that the Israeli government
has to find and neutralize. It is also true that, you know, you're still actively expecting that there are going to be
additional attacks, whether those are missile attacks or whether those are direct incursions, nobody knows, but given the level of planning
that was required by Hamas to make these strikes over the weekend, which nobody in Israel thought
was possible, no one expected it, right now, that level
of concern would be higher than anything else
on the political agenda. And again, that will not move
for the foreseeable future. HW: So I want to talk more
about all of that and expand this to obviously the broader
geopolitical implications of this. But I want to just play out the 9/11
reference a little bit if you can, because obviously 9/11
happened some time ago with the attack on the United States. But we know with retrospect,
with hindsight, that some of the decisions
that were made after that were misguided, they were misjudged, they actually led to terrible harm. How and who is going to make sure that these types
of decisions are not made? And how can Israel avoid making decisions that will be bad? IB: As someone who was in New York on 9/11 and saw the second tower go down and saw how the city rallied together,
how the country rallied together, President Bush, over 90 percent
approval in the country a couple of months after 9/11, how the world came together
to support the United States, the coalition of the willing,
well beyond NATO. I mean, poor countries that had no business caring
about what the United States was up to providing troops on the ground
and support for the Americans. Russia, Putin's Russia, calling up Bush
and offering, you know, the former Soviet republics
in Central Asia as bases to support
for logistical operations for the war in Afghanistan. I mean, the level of support
for the United States after 9/11 was singular. And there's no question
that the outpouring of concern, I mean, when I saw in Berlin, shining on the Brandenburg Gate, the Israeli flag with the star of David in Germany, in Berlin, in Germany, and given the history and given what that means and given the Alternative für
Deutschland doing well in East Germ -- all of that, I mean,
this is a singular moment in the relationship between
Germany and Israel. The European Union suspending
aid to the Palestinians, the support for Israel is extraordinary. Narendra Modi In India. It is not universal for every country, but it is absolutely wide-ranging. And I got a readout, I spoke to several of the folks involved in the Emergency
Security Council meeting at the United Nations this weekend. The condemnation of these attacks,
everyone but Russia. And again, so in that regard,
this is very, very similar to 9/11. Now, the broader question
that you're asking, Helen, which I'm also very sensitive to, is in 2023, looking back on 9/11, the Americans made some horrible,
horrible, long-lasting mistakes. And some of those mistakes
were in the United States. I mean, if I think about how much money
was spent and wasted in the Department of Homeland Security, on personal security
and safety in the airlines, how much money was wasted, how much economic inefficiency
as a consequence of overstating the terrorist
threat in the US, everything else secondary to that. But also, the rights
that were stripped back for, in some cases, all Americans in terms of surveillance
and the Patriot Act. But also targeting Muslim Americans
across the country and so much mistreatment
of American citizens as a consequence of that. But that's nothing compared
to the mistakes made internationally. A war of choice in Iraq, responding to 9/11 with trillions of dollars wasted and lives, millions of lives destroyed. Afghanistan, 20 years on, a failed war with the Taliban returning to power and a failed state. Yes, bin Laden was killed, and I think people
around the world cheered that, not just in the United States, and Al Qaeda was destroyed
at the highest levels and in many cases uprooted completely. But no one can look back
on the 20-plus years since 9/11 and say that the American response
with the war on terror was successful. You can't do that. And Israel is not the United States. The Americans have extraordinary
strength and resilience in its national security capabilities
and the size of its economy, also in where it's located geopolitically. Israel certainly has the military
strength in the region, but the the country is small. The territory is small. And certainly it is not in a geopolitical
space that is comfortable. And so I think the danger here is that as the Israelis
respond against Hamas, as they should and as they must, and as they work to destroy the leadership
of that terrorist organization and disarm the militants that are involved
in the attacks against Israel and pose an ongoing threat. But that is certainly not the only
knock-on consequences of Israel's decision making. And the potential for this
to become a broader war that would envelop
the Middle East in conflagration and that ultimately could even end Israel is real in a way that the war on terror
could not have threatened the United States existentially. And I, as a consequence,
I certainly believe that a unity government
will make it less likely that the Israelis overreact in that way. I certainly believe
that the United States, in providing very strong
and committed support, but also notes of caution
in what can be done and what should not be done, will hopefully restrain
the worst impulses. And, you know,
in the early moments, again, we all understand why Israel
would feel the need to react in the harshest possible way. But I certainly worry when I see the Israeli defense minister refer to the attackers as inhuman animals and announce a siege
on the entirety of Gaza, which means no food,
no electricity, no water. And this is a territory
that already has 50 percent poverty, already has fewer
than half of its population with access to clean water. I worry about what that is going to mean for the Palestinian people as well as for Israel long-term. You know, I think
it was Golda Meir who says, ""I won't hate you
for killing our children. I will hate you for making me
kill your children."" Ultimately, the Israeli population
is most threatened by what the terrorists of Hamas
unleash from Israel. HW: So do you think that was part
of the incentive for Hamas in doing this? Because surely they knew
that the response would be swift. And surely they knew that the world
would rally around such atrocities. So what do you think was their motivation, and do you think that they
underestimated what might happen? IB: Oh, I don't think they
underestimated what might happen. But it's a compelling question. It's really hard
to put yourself in the mindset of someone like a Hamas leader. But, you know, I had to do that just a few months ago when Yevgeny Prigozhin was marching
with his Wagner forces on Moscow. And people were asking me,
""What is going through this guy's mind?"" Because it's clear
he's going to get killed, right? I mean, you turn
against the Kremlin and Putin, you’re not walking away from that. And when he cut the “deal” and everyone said,
""Oh you know, he cut a deal"" -- He's dead man walking. Like, literally, that was the reality. And as soon as the Hamas leaders decided that they were going
to commit these atrocities against Israeli civilians, they're dead. There is no future for these people. So I think there are two
different things going on. The first, and this is
analogous to Prigozhin, is that Hamas felt themselves in an increasingly untenable environment, that they were losing
their support in the region. And even the Saudis
were about to normalize their relationship with Israel. They had no influence in ability
to get anything done, no leverage with the Israeli government, which was only becoming harder
and harder lined against them. And in that regard, they were increasingly in a corner. Their options were increasingly all bad. And, you know, we know that people that find themselves
only with horrible options frequently do irrational things. And I would not underestimate that in driving the decision of Hamas
to take that action. It's kind of like why would 77 percent
of a Gaza population in the last elections they had,
which was some time ago, why would they vote
for an organization like Hamas? Well, I mean, they wouldn't
if they had economic opportunities. They wouldn't, if they had education, they wouldn't if they could come
and go from Gaza as they please. But the worse the situation gets, the more they are willing
to vote for an organization that is prepared to burn it all down. And by the way, there's a lesson in that, even for those of us in very wealthy, very stable countries. So I think that's one set of motivations, but another set of motivations certainly is an ideological effort of Hamas to insert themselves as more dominant
in the conversation, to radicalize the Israeli population, to undermine the Palestinian
Authority in the West Bank. Because if this fight, you know, gets the Israelis to kill huge numbers
of Palestinian civilians, and by the way, Hamas
will facilitate that, right? I mean, Hamas is absolutely going to be
engaged in operations, you know, in residential buildings. They do that intentionally. They're not going to make it easy
for Israel to take them out. They want to make it bloody. They want to paint the Israelis as just
as bad as Hamas, if not worse. They will take human shields. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, usually gives warnings about when
they're about to attack a building. They ask the civilians to leave. Well, Hamas tells those civilians
that that's disinformation. They do everything they can to make the Israelis seem complicit with the kind of indiscriminate
attacks against civilians that Hamas engages in themselves. They want to bring
the Israelis to their level. And they also want to radicalize
the Palestinians in response, not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank. And they want to radicalize
the Arab street. They want people across
the region to be, you know, in uproar against Israel and in solidarity with the Hamas cause and in solidarity
with the destruction of Israel. They want Arab leaders to be saying what the Iranian supreme leader
was posting on social media this weekend, calling essentially for a genocide
against the Zionist regime. That is ideologically what Hamas
is trying to accomplish. And again, Israel must do
everything in its power not to allow Hamas to drag them there. HW: It’s interesting, in your talk
in Vancouver this year at TED2023, you were talking about the rise
of different orders, and I do just get the sense
that everything is connected. You have Russia,
you have Ukraine, you have Iran. There are these ideological battles
that are now becoming real-world wars. And so I wonder if you can,
especially the mention of Iran, I don't think it's confirmed yet,
the intervention of Iran in this, but certainly the ""Journal"" was
reporting that Iran had been involved, deeply involved
in setting up these attacks. What does this mean? What does this mean
for the world at large? And then I also have
a follow up question, which is, what do you think the US should do? IB: So let's talk in terms of the world
at large and starting with Iran, certainly that ""Wall Street Journal""
piece over the weekend drove an enormous amount of news. It was saying, hey,
the Iranians basically planned this. I will tell you, that was a very
lightly sourced piece, relying on Hamas. And I would not have gone
to print with that if I had been ""The Journal."" HW: Yeah, the US has not
confirmed that at all. IB: In fact, the US has actually said that there is not
hard evidence at this point that fingers Iran
as having directly orchestrated or ordered these attacks. Now, let's be very clear. The Iranians have publicly expressed strongest possible
support for Hamas. The Iranians have historically funded and provided military support
directly for Hamas. So they clearly are not innocents in this. And I would be surprised to learn that the Iranians had no idea
that this was going to happen. I suspect that they were aware. But awareness and orchestration
are two very different things. Now, since the attacks occurred, Hezbollah, which of course,
is also very much aligned with Iran and gets a lot of direct military support
and training from the Iranians, they have, I say only,
but in this context, is only, they've only engaged
in some missile strikes, some rocket strikes
against an Israeli military -- not base, but military outpost. A soldier’s outpost. And the Israelis, in response, immediately engaged in strikes
back against Hezbollah. That's it. If the Iranians were behind this
and wanted to be seen as behind this, Hezbollah would be involved
in these attacks. They are far more capable than Hamas. The Iranians have claimed
that they have had no role, that this was an autonomous
Hamas operation. And indeed, Iran has been doing
better geopolitically of late. The Chinese facilitated a breakthrough in Iranian relations with the Saudis. The Iranians have engaged
with the United States, and six billion dollars of Iranian assets
are set to be unfrozen, have not been unfrozen yet,
but are set to be transferred to Iran. Five American civilians
that were held unjustly as hostages in Iranian jails
have been released and sent to the United States. The Iranians have reduced
the top level of uranium enrichment and some of their stockpiles,
allowing inspectors in. Now, this is not a return to the Iranian
nuclear deal, the JCPOA, but certainly on the basis of all of that and even some high-level discussion that the Iranians might be willing
to engage directly with the United States diplomatically
through the good offices of Oman, none of that seems aligned at all with the Iranians pulling the trigger
on an attack against Israel that would almost certainly lead
to massive retaliation once the Israelis found that out. So I am sitting here saying I would be surprised, not with a high level of confidence, and, you know, the Iranian regime
has a very old supreme leader who is also dealing
with internal instability and a transition that is coming. So never say never. But I would be quite surprised
if we found out that the Iranians directly ordered this. Now, it is useful that the United States
has both sent a fleet off of the Israeli coast
to show stalwart support and will be providing a level
of at least military coordination and operational intelligence,
may well do much more than that. We can get to that when we talk
about the United States, but is also very publicly saying ""We do not yet have any evidence
that the Iranians are involved."" In other words, the message
from the United States is very clear: do not expand this war into Iran, because the consequences of that
are 150-dollar crude at a minimum. The consequences of that is the world
goes back into global recession. The consequences of that
are conflagration in the region. And I think, I do believe that the Israeli government
is quite aligned with the United States in not wanting to go there. HW: I keep coming back
to the human cost of this because the reality is
that people are suffering, people are being killed, and many more people
are likely to be killed. If, indeed Hamas has kind of
hijacked this story with extremist action, I wonder what you see
from the Palestinian side of kind of a more moderate type of push
towards trying to get understanding, trying to get peace in this nation or trying to get peace in this area. IB: I mean, that's the most
tragic piece of this, is the ability of Hamas
to successfully hijack big pieces of the political spectrum
for the Palestinians. I mean, there are so many people
in the West right now that view the Palestinians
as equivalent to Hamas, and nothing could be further
from the truth. But that reality, that perception is going
to make life so much worse for the people
that have suffered the most. They are the powerless. The Palestinians are the stateless. They lack resources. They lack a proper military. They lack the capacity
to defend their own territory and to defend themselves. And we've already seen, even over this most tragic
weekend for Israel, that the number of deaths
and casualties for the Palestinians are almost as much
as they were for the Israelis. And when you go back
over the past 20 years, who've had the most deaths, who've had the most casualties, consistently, it's been the Palestinians. Who's going to suffer
the most going forward? Consistently, it will be the Palestinians. Who suffered the most
from the US war on terror? It was, of course, the Iraqis
and all of the tribes in Afghanistan. This should not surprise anyone,
but it is the unfortunate reality that of course, Hamas leadership
will be destroyed. But the biggest damage
that they will have done would have been to their own people. To the Palestinian people, who now will face almost
unfathomable deprivation. And there’s very little that the rest
of the world is going to do about it. HW: Do you see a movement within Palestine
to step up if Hamas is done? IB: I certainly believe that the Palestinian Authority
will try to see this as an opportunity to push
for more international engagement from the region to take seriously a cessation
of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, a rolling back of the territory
that is presently occupied and a revival of peace talks that would bring about
a two-state solution where the Palestinians, less land than perhaps they would have gotten
in the days of, you know, Arafat and Rabin, but nonetheless, something that feels sustainable, a country that one might be able to raise
children with a sense of hope. There is no one in the occupied
territories of Palestine that could say that for themselves
for their children today. So I think that is the hope. But, you know, clearly right now
is not the time for that. Not because we don't want it, but because events
will overtake it immediately and have already overtaken. Now, the hope is that the violence
that will spread in the West Bank can be contained. That we do not see a war in Gaza
become a war in the West Bank, that we do not see an occupation of Gaza
become an occupation of the West Bank. That is, I think, the priority now. You have to know sometimes when you actually have
a trajectory for peace, and when you have to do
your best to avoid war expanding. We do not have a trajectory
for peace right now. We are at war. There were plenty of opportunities
over the past years to take off ramps, to engage more seriously. They were ignored. And it is precisely that reality that has brought us to a point
where we now are on defense, where we are hoping that this
does not get much, much worse. That is the story
of the Middle East today. HW: Do you think Israel will annex Gaza? IB: I think the Israelis don't know. Again, don't underestimate the shock, the emotional shock that all of the Israelis are facing today. They are not making long-term strategic
decisions right now. They are making immediate,
short-term decisions. What can we do to make sure
the country is still defended, our borders are still secure, that terrorists are not, you know, right now running around in our midst,
planning further atrocities? That is priority number one. And very close to it is getting those hostages back and safe and I'd say unharmed. They've already experienced a lot of harm. That's beyond the realm
of possibility right now. There will be, in the coming weeks,
and there's also some shock and awe, you know, Netanyahu immediately posting, some buildings getting demolished in Gaza and saying we are, you know, at war. That is, I mean, they’ve engaged
in these sorts of airstrikes before, and we already know of families
that have gotten killed, entire families in some cases of nine,
of 13 people, lots of children, this sort of thing. We will see that. But in terms of what's the nature
of the long-term objectives, the occupation, the Israelis are not close
to making that decision. And I also think that other countries
that Israel trusts and Israel needs will have some ability
to have influence over Israel in making that decision. I'm not just talking about the US now. I'm also talking
about countries in the region that Israel would like
to maintain relations with. So there needs to be very active
multilateral diplomacy behind the scenes, quietly, high-level,
with the Israeli government in the coming days and weeks. HW: I want to talk a little bit
about the media coverage of the attacks and of what is happening right now. A lot of the people who had
written in with questions for you are really confused
by the rhetoric that they're seeing. They're not sure what to trust,
who to trust, what to believe. And I want to get your sense,
you're a very online person. And so what is your take on this, and how can we think about how
to understand what's happening, especially in such a kind of,
real-time situation? IB: Well, first of all,
there's always the fog of war. There's always disinformation
from both sides actively trying to promote a narrative that is more effective for them, that they're doing better
than they otherwise are, and that the other side
is engaged in greater atrocities than they actually are. You see lots of that, lots of immediately
fake videos putting out of buildings that are being destroyed, people that are being killed, you know, sort of, people that are providing,
you know, sort of, support for, sort of, ""kill all the Jews""
and ""kill all the Palestinians"" that actually came
from previous conflicts, not from the present one. There's plenty of that. This time around, there's also so much more hatred. There's, on social media especially, there's so much more willingness
to promote, algorithmically, opinions that you would never
hear in your family, that you would never hear
in your community, in your school, but it's being bombarded. And this is very different
from the so-called mainstream media, whether it's the BBC or the Deutsche Welle or it's Fox News or CNN. No, no. Social media has become a far more greatly
polarized and hate-filled space. I've received at least 30 death threats over the last 48 hours from complete randos. A few people that I actually
could track if I really needed to, most anonymous accounts. But clearly people
that are writing me directly, some of whom are really,
really pro-Israel, some of whom are really,
really pro-Palestine and some of whom are probably
just trolling for the lolz, as they like to say. It is increasingly very hard
to navigate this space without becoming incensed and deranged. Having said that, as much as I find Twitter/X a space antithetical to civil society, I also know, as someone who does analysis, that some of the best real-time
information from sources on the ground is being passed through on X
and is not found in other places. It will not come through
in mainstream media. So for the average person, you need to spend a lot more time
filtering and figuring out where to go and who to follow. But it still is the one place
that you can go. And you know, it really does, the whole thing profoundly worries me because when you're in an environment that you can no longer know what is truth, what is real information, it is really hard to maintain
a society that is human. When you have people that are saying that all Israelis are X
and all Palestinians are Y, and that is where much of social media, I mean, a strong majority
of social media is there right now, you cannot have dialogue,
you cannot have solutions, and you can very easily tilt into war, into radicalism, into fascism. This is something we all need
to be guarded against. And I truly believe that the social media companies
need to be regulated on this. They are acting as if they have no
responsibility for what's on their sites. That, you know, it's just
like the phone company. That if you and I, Helen,
are having a conversation about blowing something up, well, we're responsible for that. But the phone company
isn't responsible, and I accept that. But, Helen, if you and I are having
a conversation about blowing something up and then the phone company
takes that conversation, identifies everyone else that might be interested in blowing
something up or has considered it, and takes that conversation
and promotes it to them, then you, the phone company,
are responsible, you are liable, you should be taken down. And we are in a war right now, and the social media companies
are actively fanning the flames. They are spraying fuel on the flames,
and they’re doing it globally. Globally, so much so that countries
like China that are authoritarian and control their media space actually have sort of an intrinsic
political stability advantage in ""information warfare""
over open societies that should be the most resilient. That’s crazy, and we can’t keep
going down that path. HW: The ironies are writ large. OK, so we are coming on our time, but I wonder if you can
leave us with a sense of what should we be watching for next? What should we be looking for? IB: First, we need to look for Lebanon. This is the issue of Hezbollah, which so far has been the dog
that has not barked. Is that going to continue? It is the place that you are most likely
to see tipping point escalation if it were to occur. And you have Hezbollah operatives
of many different stripes. They are loosely organized, they're well-trained. But that doesn't mean
that they're all following, you know, marching orders from one direct leader. The potential that this could -- you could see escalation with some
Israeli farmers getting killed, and then the Israelis respond. And before you know it,
you're in a much bigger firefight. Lebanon's involved, Hezbollah is involved,
and then it knocks on to Iran. That is sort of the gateway drug
in the Middle East even if nobody wants that fight. That's one thing to watch. Second thing to watch, of course, imminently is what happens
with these hostages. Do the Israelis get them back? Historically, that has always
been the top priority, and it is today. But Hamas has control over that. And, you know, if the Israelis
are not prepared to negotiate with Hamas to release militants presently
in Israel prisons, and it's very hard for me to imagine
in today's environment they would be willing to do that, well, how exactly do they get them back and how many of them
can they actually free? Again, you know, the Israelis
and the Americans have far, far better tradecraft on the ability
to get these hostages out than Hamas have to take them. But Hamas has exceeded expectations
over the past 48 hours, and I would worry very much about that. That would be the second thing
I'd watch most closely right now. And then finally, the nature
of the Israeli government itself. Do we have success in putting together
a unified national emergency government, in which case we will have more
stability in governance and decision making that comes from Israel and also greater willingness to consider
longer-term engagement with those Palestinians,
particularly in the West Bank, to start, at least, that might be looking
for a more constructive path now that they are back on the agenda. I don't have a high amount of optimism
that that's going to happen. But you asked me for something hopeful,
that would be something hopeful. HW: Ian Bremmer, we are so grateful
for your time and for your insight. Thank you so much
for joining us, stay well. IB: My pleasure Helen."

#TED #TEDTalks #Duolingo","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED']",2023-10-26T04:00:18-07:00,2023-10-26T04:00:18-07:00,Science & Technology,"So, I'm from Guatemala. This is a public service announcement, that is where Guatemala is. (Laughter) Also, that is not
where they keep the prisoners. That is called Guantanamo. (Laughter) Not the same place. So Guatemala's right below Mexico. And for the Americans in the audience, and let this sink in,
because it really applies in most ways, for the Americans in the audience, you can think of it as Mexico's Mexico. (Laughter) Just like the US doesn't want
illegal immigration from Mexico, Mexico doesn't want
illegal immigration from Guatemala. It's a smaller country. It's a poor country. And well, what can I tell you, it has much better Mexican food. (Laughter) Guatemala is a very poor country. And a lot of people talk about education as something that brings equality
to different social classes. But I always saw it as the opposite,
as something that brings inequality. Because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money
can buy themselves a really good education and therefore continue
having a lot of money. Whereas people who don't have
very much money barely learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money. And this is especially true
in poor countries. Now, I was fortunate that I received
a rich person's education even though I didn't grow up rich. And it’s because I’m an only child. And my mother, who was a single mother, spent all of her resources
on my education. And this allowed me to come
to college to the US and eventually get a PhD
in computer science. Now because of all of this about 10 years ago, I decided I wanted to do something that would give equal access
to education to everyone. Oh, by the way, this is what I want
to talk to you about today, giving equal access
to education to everyone. At the time, I was a professor
of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and I decided to work on this
with my PhD student, Severin. The way my brain works, all of education is just
too general of a problem. So I decided, let's start
by teaching one thing. And then I started thinking,
OK, well, what should we teach first? Should we teach math? I mean, we both love math. Me and my cofounder, we both love math. And, you know, we didn't
decide to do math. Then we started thinking, well, maybe
we should teach computer science. But eventually, and this is maybe
surprising to people in North America, eventually, we decided
that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages. And let me tell you why. There's a number of reasons. One of them is that there's
a huge audience for it. There’s about two billion people
in the world learning a foreign language, both in school and outside of schools. Most of these people, by the way,
are learning English. About 80 percent of them
are learning English. In this weird map right here, all the countries in green are countries in which people
are predominantly learning English. And the reason for that is because English can truly
transform your life. In most countries in the world, knowledge of English can significantly
increase your income potential. So this is another reason why we decided
to start with foreign languages. And it's because you can directly
make more money if you learn another language,
in particular English. And see, this is pretty different
than many other subjects. For example, take math. In the case of math, just knowledge of math does not
increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math
to then learn physics to then become a civil engineer,
that's how you make more money. Whereas with languages,
if you are a waiter and you learn English, now you can be a waiter at a hotel
and make more money. So we decided, well, let's get started
by teaching languages. Now, we also convinced ourselves that the only way
to really reach a lot of people was by using a mobile phone,
or a smartphone in particular. See, building schools all over the world
is simply too expensive. On the other hand, most of the world's population
already has access to a smartphone, and the trend is that that fraction
is only going to increase. So we decided at the time that we would make a way to learn
foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone. And then we called it Duolingo. Thank you. (Applause) Now in order to truly be accessible
to everyone, rich and poor, Duolingo uses a freemium model
to support itself. What that means is that you can learn
as much as you want without ever having to pay. But if you don't pay, you may have to see an ad
at the end of a lesson. Now, if you don't like ads, you can also pay to subscribe
to turn off the ads. And it turns out that the vast majority
of the revenue for Duolingo comes from people who pay
to subscribe to turn off the ads. Now, who are these people who pay
to subscribe to turn off the ads? Well, they're usually well-off people
in rich countries like the US and Canada. Who are the people
who don't pay to subscribe? They usually come from poorer countries
like Brazil or Vietnam or Guatemala. So what I like about this model is that it is a small form
of wealth redistribution because we're basically
getting the rich people to pay for the education of everyone. So I like that. (Applause) So with smartphones,
we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people
to pay for the whole thing, which is great. However, if you're trying to deliver
education with a smartphone, you run into a humongous problem. And it is that smartphones come equipped with some of the most addictive drugs
that humanity has ever engineered. TikTok, Instagram, mobile games. See, delivering education
over a smartphone is like hoping that people
will eat their broccoli, but right next to it, you put
the most delicious dessert ever made. (Laughter) If you really want to deliver
education to everyone, not only do you have
to make it accessible, but also you have to make it
so that people want to actually learn. And with Duolingo,
we've been able to do this. And at the highest level,
the way we've done this is by making the broccoli
taste like dessert. I'll say it another way. What we've done is that we've used
the same psychological techniques that apps like Instagram,
TikTok or mobile games use to keep people engaged, but in this case, we use them
to keep people engaged but with education. Let me give you some examples
of these techniques. One of the most powerful ones
is the notion of a streak. What a streak is, is it’s just a counter that measures the number of days that you've used
the product consecutively. You just take that number, you put it very prominently
in your product and then people come back every day. And the reason people come back
every day is because, well, if they don't come back,
that number resets to zero and people don't want
to lose their streak. It works. Now, on the one side, streaks have been criticized
for, for example, getting teens addicted to Snapchat. But in the case of an educational app, streaks get people to come back
to study every day. Now, to give you an idea
of the power of streaks, in the case of Duolingo, we have over three million
daily active users that have a streak longer than 365. (Applause) That means they haven't missed a day
in the last year or longer. Now, fun fact about streaks. What country do you think
has the longest average streaks for an educational app? It's Japan. Of course. Shortest-ever streaks? Latin America, baby. (Laughter) But we're fun, hey, we're fun. (Laughter) Another important mechanism to get people
to come back to your product are notifications. On the one side, notifications
can be really spammy and annoying, but in the case of an educational product, people actually want
to be reminded to learn. In the case of Duolingo, we have
a very sophisticated AI system that basically chooses
when to send the notification and also what to say in each notification to maximize the probability
that people come back. Now, interestingly, even after all this sophistication, it turns out that the algorithm
for choosing what time to send you a notification
is pretty simple. Do you know what is the best time
to send people a notification? I'll tell you. It's 24 hours after
they used the product last. There's an easy explanation. If you were free yesterday at 3pm, you’re probably free today
at 3pm as well. So this is what a very sophisticated
millions of dollars of AI found. (Laughter) It's funny. Now with notifications
you shouldn't be spamming. And we're not spamming, with Duolingo, we actually stop sending notifications
after seven days of inactivity. So if you don't use Duolingo
for seven days, we stop sending you notifications. Now, at some point it occurred to us, if we're stopping
to send people notifications, we should let them know. So we started sending
this notification to people saying, ""Hey, these reminders
don't seem to be working. We'll stop sending them for now."" You know what people do
when they get this notification? They come back. (Laughter) Passive aggressive. (Laughter) Works for my mother, works for Duolingo. (Laughter and applause) These passive aggressive notifications are really good at getting
people to come back back because they feel like our green
owl mascot has given up on them, so they come back. And speaking of our
green owl mascot, by the way, because all our notifications come
from our green owl mascot and well, he's passive aggressive
and also pretty pushy, this has given rise to a lot
of memes on the internet that make fun of the great lengths
that he will go through to get you back to learn a language. Here's one of my favorite ones. This is it's a meme,
it’s one of my favorite ones. (Laughter) Basically looks like you forgot
your Spanish lessons. And then there's an intruder alert, presumably the owl broke into your house
to get you to learn language. Now, Duolingo has entered the zeitgeist. And there's thousands of memes,
there's SNL skits about it. And it's because we've managed
to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that mobile games and social media use
to get people engaged. And this is a really important point, let me say this. I don't actually believe that there's
a way to make an educational app be as engaging as something like TikTok
or Instagram or mobile games. But the good news is that -- And by the way, the reason
I don't believe that is because ultimately you have
to teach people something. And it's hard to compete with,
like, cats and celebrities. But the good news is
that I don't think you have to. See, here's the thing. When you're learning something,
you get meaning out of it. Whereas when you're scrolling
for two hours on Instagram, a lot of times afterwards, you feel
like you just wasted your time. So I think it's actually OK
if your educational product is only 80 or 90 percent as engaging
as something like TikTok, because the other 10 or 20 percent will be provided
by people's internal motivation, though of course, not much more than that. This is really a key point. If we want to get people
to do something meaningful, you can use the same techniques
that apps like social media use to get people to do it. And even if you're not as engaging
as those apps are, you can still get hundreds of millions
of people to use your product. In the case of Duolingo, for example, there are more people learning languages
on Duolingo in the United States than there are people learning languages
across all US high schools combined. (Applause) And this is true
in most countries in the world. My hope is that -- I know
we can do this, but, you know, my hope is that as humanity, we can do what Duolingo has done
for learning languages but for all other subjects. Where we can get people
to learn math with mobile phones, like millions of people to learn
math with mobile phones or physics or whatever. I hope for a future in which
screen time is not a bad thing, in which we can deliver high-quality
education to everyone, rich or poor, using a mobile phone. But the single most important thing
that I can end this talk with, is a reminder to please,
pretty please, I beg you, do your language lessons today. Thank you very much. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Luis, thank you so much. I wonder if you can just say
a little bit more about that last point, how do you think you can apply
this type of thinking to other subjects? So you mentioned math,
and things like that. How do you do that? Luis von Ahn: I think in particular, subjects that are learned
through repetition and it turns out most things
that are kind of really meaningful are learned through
thousands of repetitions. You learn to read through repetition, you learn elementary school math
through repetition. Most things that you can learn
through repetition, you can actually gamify
and turn into something like Duolingo, where people just
do it a lot and do it fun. It's a little harder for things
like explanations. That probably is going to require
some really good videos. Sal Khan is doing a really
good job with that. But for things that require
a lot of repetition, I think we can use the same methods. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #design #culture","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'design', 'art', 'history', 'humanity', 'Terry Moore']",2023-08-16T04:00:21-07:00,2023-08-16T04:00:21-07:00,Science & Technology,"This is Roger Penrose. Certainly one of the great
scientists of our time, winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work reconciling black holes with Einstein's general
theory of relativity. But back in the 1970s, Roger Penrose made a contribution
to the world of mathematics and that part of mathematics
known as tiling. You know, tiling, the process
of putting tiles together so that they form a particular pattern. The thing that was remarkable about the pattern
that Roger Penrose developed is that by using only two shapes, he constructed a pattern that could be
expanded infinitely in any direction without ever repeating. Much like the number pi
has a decimal that isn’t random, but it will go on forever
without repeating. In mathematics, this is a property
known as aperiodicity and the notion of an aperiodic tile set
using only two tiles was such a sensation, it was given the name Penrose tiling. Here's Roger Penrose, now Sir Roger Penrose, standing on a field of Penrose tiles. Then in 2007, this man, Peter Lu, who was then a graduate student
in physics at Princeton, while on vacation
with his cousin in Uzbekistan, discovered this pattern
on a 14th century madrassa. And after some analysis, concluded that this was,
in fact, Penrose tiling 500 years before Penrose. (Laughter) That information took
the scientific world by storm and prompted headlines everywhere, including “Discover” magazine, which proclaimed this the 59th
most important scientific discovery of the year 2007. So now we've heard
about this amazing pattern from the point of view of mathematics and from physics and now art
and archeology. So that leads us to the question what was there about this pattern that this ancient culture
found so important that they put it on their
most important building? So for that, we look to the world of anthropology
and ask the question, What was the worldview
of the culture that made this? And this is what we learn. This pattern is life. And as you can see, life's complicated. It's complicated. But not only is life complicated, life is also aperiodic in the sense
that every event, every happening, every decision will make
the future unfold differently, often in ways that are
impossible to predict. Yet, in spite of the complexity and in spite of a future
that's impossible to predict, there remains an underlying unity
that holds everything together and gives rise to everything. Let's see how that works in a design much like the one
Peter Lu found in Uzbekistan. This is that design. Now, it turns out this is actually
based on this set of Penrose tiles, which are reducible to these shapes. And in order to draw these shapes, the medieval craftsmen who did this would have done them
by using these construction lines. And I add here that the construction lines
don't appear in the final work. But if we add them back, we have this. And now if we weave them together,
we will have this. And now if we hide the tiles and just look at the construction lines, we see this. Clearly there's an underlying
structure and unity to things that seem to be
complex and aperiodic. This notion of a hidden underlying unity
was common throughout the ancient world, and one sees it in Egypt, in Greece, in Australia, in Mesoamerica, in North America, in Europe and in the Middle East. Now in the modern West,
we might call this underlying unity “God,” but throughout the ages, other terms have been used
to describe the same thing. This is what Plato called “first cause.” In the medieval period, philosopher Spinoza called this
the “singular substance.” In the 20th century, a number of terms
were coined to describe this, one of my favorites being from philosopher
Alfred North Whitehead, who called this the “undifferentiated
aesthetic continuum.” Doesn't that have
a 20th century sound to it? But for me, a lover of science that I am, I will take the term coined by the great
20th century physicist David Bohm, who called this the “implicate order.” So what's the takeaway here? Very simply, this. When we see these wonderful designs created by cultures
that are separated from our own by thousands of miles
or thousands of years, we can know these aren't decorations. These are statements about the fundamental
values that culture had, what they found important,
how they saw themselves, the world and themselves in the world. It has been said that architecture
is a book written in stone. So when we see these amazing designs,
we can know they're not decorations. They're a statement. They're a message. Look, listen. You can hear their voices. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #conspiracy","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'social change', 'relationships', 'communication', 'community', 'United States', 'Peter McIndoe']",2023-09-13T06:31:36-07:00,2023-09-13T06:31:36-07:00,Science & Technology,"Hi, I'm Peter. And six years ago, I received information that changed
the course of the rest of my life. From 1969 through 2001, the US government
murdered over 12 billion birds in the American skies. They did this using poisonous toxins
dropped from airplanes that was contagious
and murdered all of the birds over the course of about 40 years. Now, I know this is not the public
understanding of this and may sound absurd, but please just bear with me
and keep an open mind and just be respectful, please,
as I share this information with you. I know a lot of you may be wondering why would the government
kill 12 billion birds? It seems like an awful lot of trouble
for a government to go through. The reason is as devastating
as it is simple. For each bird the government killed, they replaced it with a surveillance
drone replica in disguise designed to spy on the American people. Now ... Some may say, if you're the government, at least, that this is a worthy sacrifice,
these 12 billion lives, for the safety of the people, right? I don't know about that, it seems like a pretty serious
limit on our freedom, wouldn't you agree? The proof that birds are robots
is all around us, if you start looking. For starters, birds charge
their batteries on power lines -- (Laughter) So they can refuel up high and they can watch
the civilians, you know. They also track civilians
using a liquid tracking device. (Laughter) You ever wonder
why birds poop on your car? Do you need more evidence? Really, I can go all day up here. Who here has seen a baby pigeon? You haven't, have you? It's weird. There's all these adult pigeons
where are all the babies? They come out of the factory
as adults, so ... (Laughter) There's no organic growth, you know. It's a smoking gun. Over the years, as I began putting
this information together, I began realizing the extent of all this. And there were times I wished
I never even learned this. My life would be so much easier. You know, I remember before
I knew this information, I was happier, my steps were lighter, you know. But I always come back to this. It is my moral obligation as one of the few
privileged enough to know this, to share it with you,
the blind sheep, you know. (Laughter) And that's what I've been
doing for years now. I'm a part of a movement
called Birds Aren't Real. And in 2021, I was promoted to public
information officer for the movement. It's the honor of my life. I had one job. Oh, thank you, thank you. (Applause) Thank you. My one job was to deprogram
the public from the bird lie. And deprogram is a very specific word
because you all are programmed. You know that, right? We live in a pro-bird civilization
drenched in propaganda. For instance, every state
has a state bird, the national mascot is a bald eagle, presidents don't talk, they tweet, then the tweets are covered
on the bird-logo media. Once I knew this,
my first order of business was to get the information out
to the American people, get off the internet into the real world. So that's what I did. I bought a van, covered it in decals with facts. I wanted to turn the highway
into an information highway, awaken the people. I went city to city, holding rallies, meeting up with our thousands
of supporters, growing by the day. And I was putting up billboards
wherever we went, sharing our simple but powerful message. Look how beautiful it is. Now, the government, (Laughter) the government did take note
of what we were doing and they sent some intimidators
to try and deter us from our mission. You can see them right there. (Laughter) But we did not fold. We kept on going. We started holding rallies at some
of the most evil pro-bird corporations in the world, starting with Twitter, where we brought hundreds out
to protest their pro-bird logo. Months later, we brought 500 people
out to CNN headquarters to demand fairer coverage
for bird truthers on air. Then just last year, we brought 2,000 people out
to Washington Square in New York City to demand that the mayor
shut down every pigeon in the city. (Laughter) Here's what that looked like. (Crowd shouting) Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! Birds aren't real! (Laughter) Can't even tell you how that felt. I took that video standing on the top
of the van, megaphone in hand, knowing we were awakening a country
that needs it so badly. I can't think of anything more beautiful. OK, let me start this talk over. I do not actually believe
that birds are robots. And everyone else in this picture
is also in on the bit. This is a character
that I played for four years. The leader of a fake movement
with fake evidence and a fake history. Our goal was to convince the public that our satirical movement
was a real one. And see if the media would believe
what we were saying. To do this, I played this character
that I just showed you. We held rallies, put up billboards. We even sent the media
a lot of fake evidence. We hired an old actor
to pose as an ex-CIA agent confessing to his crimes. We sent them a historic email leak
called ""Poultry Gate"" that came out of the Pentagon, (Laughter) where we forged hundreds of fake emails exposing elites and government officials
in the bird drone surveillance plot. It didn't take much to convince the media. After just one summer
holding rallies like this, it became nationally syndicated news on tons of local news stations that we were a real movement
that had been around for 50 years. And there was a resurgence happening
where it was coming back and there was a radical new leader,
myself, bringing the movement back as the rise of conspiracy theories
swept the nation. At this point, I'm sitting on my couch, watching the media report
on my fake movement as a real one and figure it is probably time
to come out of character. One, because we'd accomplished
what we came there to do. But also, I didn't want this to snowball
in anything that was never supposed to. So in 2021, I broke character, revealed the movement was a farce
on the front page of The New York Times. And I was very proud, as you can see. Allow me to reintroduce
myself one more time. Hi, I'm Peter. Can you say, ""Hi, Peter?"" (Audience) Hi, Peter. Hey. I'd like to tell you
a little bit about myself. I grew up in Arkansas in Little Rock, where I was home-schooled
on the outskirts of town. The community that I grew up with
was hyper conservative and religious, and almost everyone that I knew believed
in some form of conspiracy theory, whether it was that Obama
was the Antichrist or that there are microchips
in the vaccines. During my entire life, I always felt like
I was on the fringes of normal society. So, as you can imagine, when it became time for me
to play a character, the conspiracy theorist was a pretty
easy one for me to tap into. During the years in character,
I used the same cadence, logic and arguments
as those I grew up around, just with a different theory swapped in. I was really dedicated to playing
this character as convincingly as I could, as method as possible. So I spent days, sometimes, in character, a lot of time out in public
with the van there, just talking with strangers. It led to hundreds
of interactions with strangers who thought that I was
a real conspiracy theorist. I'd often be out there, cowboy hat on, handing out fliers that said things like, ""If it flies, it's spies."" (Laughter) We had another flyer that said, ""Birdwatching goes both ways."" (Laughter) And during these times, as I'm handing
out flyers and talking with people, there were hundreds, maybe thousands
of instances over the years where strangers would approach me. You know, they'd see me in public
and I'd see them notice me. And walk up to me with complete
disdain on their face. They thought that I was
a real conspiracy theorist. And time and time again,
they'd come up to me, look me right in the eyes,
just as close as I am to you right here, and they would tell me how stupid I am. They'd tell me I was uneducated,
that I was crazy. That I was the problem with this country. When this happens, I didn't feel the emotions
of the character that I thought I would. My out-of-character self
may interpret these interactions as a funny response to someone
that fell for the comedy project, but instead I felt the emotions
of the character. I felt emboldened
and I felt sad and angry. Like they didn't even take
the time to know me. They instantly condemned me,
judged me and othered me. I'd found myself on the opposite side
of this equation that I'd grown up around, the normal and the fringe. And in those moments
when those people were talking to me, they could not have been more ineffective at what I would assume they really want. Less conspiracy theorists in the world. These experiences, hundreds
of them over the years, watching how people interact
with those on the fringes of our society gave me an entirely new perspective
on our approach to conspiracy theorists, whether it's how we frame them
in the conventional media, to how we deal with those
in our own lives. If our goal is to live in a shared
reality with our neighbors, what if our current approach
isn't bringing us any closer to that? What if by talking to conspiracy theorists
like they're ignorant and stupid, we're actually pushing them
farther away from the truth that we want them to see? Because what happens when someone
tells you that you're stupid, you're all wrong, you're the problem? You'll feel judged and dismissed. And most importantly, you’ll feel othered, which may lead you to look for safety in those who are like-minded to do what they have been doing for you. Affirm your selfhood, give you
a sense of identity, belonging. These are some of the most
basic human desires. We have to consider
that conspiracy theorists are not just joining
these groups for no reason. They're getting rewards out of these, things that we are all looking for, a sense of purpose, community. I grew up with the internet and during my time with this project,
especially out of character, people have talked to me
about the misinformation age and this, you know, terrifying problem
of online echo chambers and conspiracy theorists. But I want to remind us that there are
humans behind a lot of these screens. It's not just numbers. Everyone’s unique experience influences
their own narrative about the world, and there's no blueprint
for how to deal with this yet. But I do not think that online
echo chambers of conspiracy theorists are this inevitable
symptom of life online. The internet is about 30 years old
and things are changing quickly, and I think it'll be very important
that we develop new solutions for these new problems
on a fundamental level. What if by addressing belief
before belonging, we're starting the conversation
at the wrong place? Instead of sitting in collective
bewilderment and frustration about how these people
could believe these things, these crazies, what if we first looked under the hood and thought about what made them
vulnerable to this information in the first place? What might they be getting out of this that they're not getting
in their everyday lives? How much does it have to do
with a different truth, or how much does it have to do
with the community that that truth brings? We need to think
about people's circumstances and reference points, to see them as fellow human beings
who want to believe in something and want to belong,
just like all of us do in this room. Because if we continue
with our current approach of arguing on the level of belief, it's not going to get us anywhere. We're going to end up
with more echo chambers, more disinformation and more polarization. Instead, we can do the harder work
of looking into what is fueling the need for an alternate truth. Not only would this lend us more empathy for those who think differently than us, but I really think this might be
the only actually productive means, productive means, of moving toward the shared reality
that we all want to live in. Let's direct our energy
toward the crisis of belonging. And then maybe we will understand
the crisis of belief. Before I go, I'll leave
with one more word. Just don’t forget: if it flies, it's spies. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #parenting","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'psychology', 'relationships', 'communication', 'parenting', 'personal growth', 'mental health', 'Becky Kennedy']",2023-09-14T04:00:30-07:00,2023-09-14T04:00:30-07:00,People & Blogs,"Alright, quick poll -- raise your hand if you have
a relationship in your life that's meaningful to you. OK, I assumed, but always good
to check our assumptions. (Laughter) I’m saying this because while I'll be focusing today
on a parent-child relationship, please know that everything
I'm talking about is applicable to any
meaningful relationship. So with that in mind, let's jump in. So it's Sunday night, I'm in my kitchen. I just finished cooking
dinner for my family, and I am on edge. I mean, I'm exhausted,
I haven't been sleeping well. I’m anxious about the upcoming workweek, I'm overwhelmed by all the items
on my unfinished to-do list. And then, my son walks into the kitchen. He looks at the table and whines, ""Chicken again?"" (Laughter) ""Disgusting."" (Laughter) And that's it. I snap. I look at him and I yell, ""What is wrong with you? Can you be grateful
for one thing in your life?"" And things get worse from there. He screams, ""I hate you."" He runs out of the room
and he slams his bedroom door. And now, my self-loathing session begins, as I say to myself,
""What is wrong with me? I've messed up my kid forever."" Well, if you're a parent,
you've probably felt that pain. For me, it comes
with an extra layer of shame. I mean, I’m a clinical psychologist and my specialty is helping people
become better parents. (Laughter) And yet, this is true as well -- there is no such thing
as a perfect parent. Mistakes and struggles,
they come with the job, but no one tells us what to do next. Do we just move on? Kind of just pretend
the whole thing never happened? Or if I say something,
what are the words? Well, for years, as a clinical
psychologist in private practice, I saw client after client
struggle with this question. And now, as the creator of the parenting
content and community platform ""Good Inside,"" I see millions of parents
around the globe struggle with this issue. All parents yell. No one knows what to do next. Well, I'm determined to fill this gap. After all, there's almost nothing
within our interpersonal relationships that can have as much impact as repair. Whenever a parent asks me, ""What one parenting strategy
should I focus on?"" I always say the same thing: ""Get good at repair."" So what is repair? Repair is the act of going back
to a moment of disconnection. Taking responsibility for your behavior and acknowledging the impact
it had on another. And I want to differentiate
a repair from an apology, because when an apology often looks
to shut a conversation down -- “Hey, I’m sorry I yelled.
Can we move on now?” -- a good repair opens one up. And if you think about what it means
to get good at repair, there's so much baked-in realism
and hope and possibility. Repair assumes there's been a rupture. So to repair, you have to mess up or fall short of someone
else's expectations. Which means the next time
I snap at my kid, or my husband, or my work colleague, instead of berating myself, like I did that night in the kitchen, I try to remind myself I'm focusing
on getting good at repair. Step one is rupture. ""Check that off, I crushed it."" (Laughter) Step two is repair. ""I can do this. I'm actually right on track."" So let's get back to my example. I'm in the kitchen, my son is in his room. Well, what will happen if I don't repair? That’s really important to understand and helps us make a decision
about what to do next. Well, here are the facts. My son is alone, overwhelmed and in a state of distress, because, let's face it,
his mom just became scary mom. And now, he has to figure out
a way to get back to feeling safe and secure. And if I don't go help him do that
through making a repair, he has to rely on one of the only
coping mechanisms he has at his own disposal ... self-blame. Self-blame sounds like this: “Something’s wrong with me. I’m unlovable. I make bad things happen.” Ronald Fairbairn may have said it best
when he wrote that, for kids, it is better to be a sinner
in a world ruled by God than to live in a world
ruled by the devil. In other words, it's actually adaptive for a child to internalize
badness and fault, because at least then,
they can hold onto the idea that their parents
and the world around them is safe and good. And while self-blame
works for us in childhood, we all know it works
against us in adulthood. “Something’s wrong with me. I make bad things happen. I’m unlovable.” These are the core fears
of so many adults. But really, we see here,
they are actually the childhood stories we wrote when we were left alone following distressing events
that went unrepaired. Plus, adults with self-blame
are vulnerable to depression, anxiety, deep feelings of worthlessness -- none of which we want for our kids. And we can do better. And it doesn't mean we have to be perfect. When you repair, you go further than removing
a child's story of self-blame. You get to add in all the elements
that were missing in the first place. Safety, connection, coherence,
love, goodness. It's as if you're saying to a child, ""I will not let this chapter
of your life end in self-blame. Yes, this chapter will still contain
the event of yelling, but I can ensure this chapter
has a different ending, and therefore a different title,
and theme and lesson learned."" We know that memory is original events combined with every other time
you've remembered that event. This is why therapy's helpful, right? When you remember painful
experiences from your past within a safer and more
connected relationship, the event remains, but your story of the event,
it changes, and then you change. With repair, we effectively change the past. So let's write a better story. Let's learn how to repair. Step one, repair with yourself. That's right. I mean, you can't offer compassion or groundedness or understanding
to someone else before you access
those qualities within yourself. Self-repair means
separating your identity, who you are, from your behavior, what you did. For me, it means telling myself
two things are true. I’m not proud of my latest behavior and my latest behavior doesn't define me. Even as I struggle on the outside,
I remain good inside. I can then start to see
that I'm a good parent -- identity -- who was having a hard time -- behavior. And no, this doesn't let me off the hook. This is precisely what leaves me
on the hook for change. Because now that I've replaced
my spiral with groundedness, I can actually use my energy toward thinking about what I want
to do differently the next time. Oh, and I can now use my energy
to go repair with my son. Step two -- repair with your child. There's no exact formula. I often think about three elements: name what happened, take responsibility, state what you would do
differently the next time. It could come together like this. ""Hey. I keep thinking about what happened
the other night in the kitchen. I'm sorry I yelled. I'm sure that felt scary. And it wasn't your fault. I'm working on staying calm,
even when I'm frustrated."" A 15-second intervention
can have a lifelong impact. I've replaced my child's
story of self-blame with a story of self-trust
and safety and connection. I mean, what a massive upgrade. And to give a little more clarity
around how to repair, I want to share a few examples
of what I call ""not repair,"" which are things that come
more naturally to most of us -- definitely me included. ""Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you
in the kitchen, but if you wouldn't have
complained about dinner, it wouldn't have happened."" (Laughter) Been there? Been there? OK. Or ""You know, you really need to be
grateful for things in your life, like a home-cooked meal. Then, you won't get yelled at."" (Laughter) Not only do these interventions
fail at the goal of reconnection, they also insinuate that your child
caused your reaction, which simply isn’t true and isn't a model of emotion regulation
we want to pass on to the next generation. (Applause) So let's say we've all resisted the ""it was your fault,
anyway"" not-repairs, and have instead prioritized
a repair that allows us to reconnect. What might the impact be?
What might that look like in adulthood? My adult child won’t spiral in self-blame
when they make a mistake, and won’t take on blame
for someone else’s mistake. My adult child will know how to take
responsibility for their behavior, because you've modeled
how to take responsibility for yours. Repairing with a child today sets the stage for these critical
adult relationship patterns. Plus, it gets better -- now that I've reconnected with my son,
I can do something really impactful. I can teach him a skill
he didn't have in the first place, which is how kids
actually change their behavior. So maybe the next day, I say ""You know, you're not always
going to like what I make for dinner. Instead of saying 'that's disgusting,' I wonder if you could say
'not my favorite.'"" Now I'm teaching him how to regulate
his understandable disappointment, and communicate effectively
and respectfully with another person. That never would have happened if instead, I had been blaming him for my reaction. So here's the point where you might have
a lingering concern. Maybe you're thinking, ""You know, I have a feeling
that my kid's older than your kid."" (Laughter) ""I think it's too late."" Or ""I have done a lot worse
than you did in the kitchen."" (Laughter) ""Maybe it's too late."" Well, I mean this -- if you have only one takeaway
from this talk, please let this be it:
It is not too late. It is never too late. How do I know? Well, imagine, right after this,
you get a call from one of your parents, and if neither of your parents are alive, imagine finding and opening a letter
you hadn't seen till that moment. OK, walk through this
with me, here's the call. ""Hey, I know this sounds out of the blue, but I've been thinking a lot
about your childhood. And I think there were a lot of moments
that felt really bad to you. And you are right to feel that way. Those moments weren't your fault. They were times when I was struggling, and if I could have gone back,
I would have stepped aside, I would have calmed myself down, and then found you to help you
with whatever you were struggling with. I'm sorry. And if you're ever willing to talk to me
about any of those moments, I'll listen. I won't listen to have a rebuttal.
I'll listen to understand. I love you."" I don't know many adults
who don't have a fairly visceral reaction to that exercise. I often hear, “Why am I crying?” Or ""Listen, that wouldn't
change everything. But it might change some things."" Well, I definitely
do not specialize in math, but here's something
I know with certainty. If you have a child,
that child is younger than you are. (Laughter) Always true. The story of their life is shorter and even more amenable to editing. So if that imagined exercise
had an impact on you, imagine the impact an actual repair
will have on your child. See? I told you, it's never too late. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #fossilfuel #climatechange","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'global issues', 'sustainability', 'business', 'pollution', 'finance', 'policy', 'fossil fuels', 'Countdown']",2023-08-07T08:40:07-07:00,2023-08-07T08:40:07-07:00,Science & Technology,"The most important question these days is how can we speed up
the solutions to the climate crisis? I'm convinced we are going
to solve the climate crisis. We've got this. But the question remains,
will we solve it in time? Others have said we're kind of in a race. I'll give you the the shortest
definition of the problem. If I was going to give a one-slide
slide show, it would be this slide. That's the troposphere,
the lowest part of the atmosphere. And you already know why it's blue. That's the oxygen
that refracts the blue light. And if you could drive a car at highway
speed straight up in the air, you'd get to the top of that blue
line in about five to seven minutes. You could walk it in an hour. And all of the greenhouse gas
pollution is below you. That's what we're using as an open sewer. That's the problem. And it's causing a lot of second
and third order consequences. And we saw some of them
in the northern-tier cities, including Detroit. This one's from New York City,
all the fires in Canada. And we have gotten used to the fact
that the world suffers deep droughts and huge rain bombs and downpours
and floods simultaneously. The really ingenious new
gravity-measuring satellite has given us, for the first time, the opportunity to see
how this plays out worldwide. We get these huge surpluses of water, the rain bombs and the drought
simultaneously. And as you can see,
the amplitude is increasing. And at both ends of our planet right now,
we're seeing signs of distress. Of course, you know, I've often said, every night on the TV news
is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. And just today, big flooding in Montpelier, Vermont, in southern Japan, in India. And I haven't done a complete scan, but every single day, it's like that. But in Antarctica, some scientists who are normally
pretty levelheaded are getting a little bit freaked out,
I would say, is a fair definition, about the lowest level ever,
at this point in the year, of sea ice. And at the other pole,
in the North Atlantic, we're seeing literally
off-the-charts temperatures. So obviously, the crisis
has to be addressed. And the good news is,
as others have often said, we are seeing tremendous progress. And it starts with the Inflation Reduction
Act here in the United States. President Biden, the Congress,
they have passed the best, biggest climate legislation
in all of history, and it's said to be 369 billion. But the heavy lifting
is done by tax credits, and most of them are open-ended. And the early applications already show it's going to be well over
a trillion dollars, maybe 1.2 trillion. So this is really good news. And one month after that passed, Australia changed its government
and started changing its laws. And it's now a pro-climate nation. A month after that,
Brazil did the same thing, new president, new policies
protecting the Amazon. And throughout, the European Union
has resisted the efforts of Russia to blackmail it into supporting its sadistic and cruel
invasion of Ukraine. And there are other signs
of success as well. China's reached its renewables target
five years ahead of time. It's still building a lot of coal,
but only 50 percent capacity utilization. So there is lots of good news. But still, in spite of this progress, the emissions are still going up. And the crisis is still getting worse faster than we are deploying
the solutions. So maybe it's time to look
at the obstacles that are standing in our way. I'm going to focus on two
of them this afternoon. First of all, the unrelenting opposition
from the fossil fuel industry. A lot of people think
they're on side and trying to help. But let me tell you, and the activists will all tell you this, every piece of legislation,
whether it's at the municipal level, the regional or provincial level, the national level
or the international level, they're in there with their lobbyists
and with their fixers and with their revolving-door colleagues doing everything they can
to slow down progress. So speeding up progress means
doing something about this. They have used fraud on a massive scale. They’ve used falsehoods
on an industrial scale. And they’ve used their legacy political
and economic networks, lavishly funded, to capture the policy-making process
in too many countries around the world. And the [UN] Secretary General said the fossil fuel industry is the polluted
heart of the climate crisis. Now, that's not to say that the men
and women who've worked in fossil fuel for the last century and a half
are not due our gratitude. They are, and they didn't cause this. But for decades now, the companies
have had the evidence. They know the truth, and they consciously
decided to lie to publics all around the world in order to calm down
the political momentum for doing something about it
so they can make more money. It's simple as that. (Applause) And now they have brazenly seized
control of the COP process, especially this year's COP in Dubai
in the United Arab Emirates. And concern has been building
about this for quite some time. I remember when there were so many
fossil fuel delegates in Madrid, but by the time we got to Glasgow
a year and a half ago, the delegates from
the fossil fuel companies made up a larger group
than the largest national delegation. And why? Why? Because they're helping? They're not helping,
they're trying to stop progress. And last year in Egypt, they had more delegates
than the combined delegations of the ten most affected
countries by climate. And now this year's host,
which is a petro state, has appointed the president of COP28, in spite of the fact that he has
a blatant conflict of interest, he's the CEO of the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company owned by Abu Dhabi. Their emissions are larger
than those of ExxonMobil, and they have no credible plan
whatsoever to reduce them. So this is the person
in charge of the COP. He's a nice guy. He's a smart guy. But a conflict of interest
is a conflict of interest. And a matter of fact, they have a plan now to have
a new increase in their emissions. Their plan is to increase
the production of both oil and gas by as much as 50 percent by 2030. Which is the same time frame when the world is trying
to reduce emissions, by 50 percent by 2030. And the same person has been put in charge
of both of those efforts. Direct conflict of interest. I think it's time to say, wait a minute, do you take us for fools? Do you think you can just completely
remove the disguise and we won't notice? The fossil fuel industry has captured
this process and is slowing it down. And we need to do something about it. Now, they plan to increase
their emissions -- (Applause) Getting all hot and bothered here. (Laughter) The head of the International
Energy Agency was talking about several oil companies who have publicly pledged
to increase their oil and gas and simultaneously pledged
to comply with the Paris Agreement. Do you take us for fools? You cannot do both
of those things simultaneously. And if you think we believe you
when you say that, we beg to differ. Last year at the COP, the fossil fuel petro states vetoed any mention of phasing down fossil fuels. They say, oh, that's not the problem. One of the secretary of state
equivalent in Saudi Arabia said, we don't see this
as a discussion about fossil fuels. Let me tell you, the climate crisis
is a fossil fuel crisis. The solutions are going
to come from a discussion and collaboration
about phasing out fossil fuels. And there's only so much longer
they can hold this up and tie us down and keep us
from doing the right thing. Now the director general
of this year's COP, working under Sultan Al Jaber,
he worked for ADNOC also, he was seconded for several
years to ExxonMobil. He said, no, that’s all changed.
This year, they’ve changed. The fossil fuel companies
are really engaging us. They have changed. Yes, they have changed. They've changed for the worse this year. You don't believe me? Look at this, BP. They said, ""We're going to net zero,
there's no turning back."" A few months ago this year,
they turned back and they decided to roll back
their investments. ExxonMobil. Oh, my God. This is minor compared to their
industrial-scale lying, you know. But they've had all the TV ads on,
particularly in the US, about revolutionizing biofuels. ""You wouldn't believe what algae can do."" Well, for 14 years they ran this program. And they spent 50 percent
as much on the ads about the program as they did on actually trying
to come up with new biofuels. And then a couple of months ago,
they said, ""Oh, we've changed our mind. We're just going to cancel that program."" The industry as a whole has not been acting in good faith. Shell reversed its commitment to increase
their investments in fossil fuels. They announced just a couple of months ago
they're going to plow that money into expanding oil and gas
production instead. So did they miss the memo? Well, no, they say
they've discovered a way out. They're telling us now
that the problem is not fossil fuels. It's the emissions from fossil fuels. And so all we have to do is to capture
the emissions from the fossil fuels. Now, I'm all for research and development into trying to capture emissions or sucking it out of the air
if they want to do that. But let's don't pretend it's for real. Maybe someday it will be. Maybe someday it will be. (Applause) This is the head of ExxonMobil
saying, ""Not oil and gas, it's the emissions."" And Abu Dhabi, they have said they've already
decreased their emissions from producing oil and gas, 99.2 percent. The point two makes it sound
even more authoritative. (Laughter) Is that feasible? Have they really done that? Is their carbon capture technology
that’s that good? Well, Climate TRACE can measure. Now, let's just look. There's their CCS capability. Oh, but they've got a great
improvement in the work. Seven years from now, they're going to have a 500 percent
increase in their capacity. But here are the emissions
from oil and gas production alone. And here are the emissions
of greenhouse gases from Abu Dhabi, from the UAE. Now, the pathetic little sliver there compared to the reality, again, do they think we don't see
what they're doing, don't understand what they're doing? A lot of people maybe just want
to look away from it. Pretty ironic here in this country. You know, the coal-burning utilities have been given a new mandate
this year by the EPA. You've got to clean up your act. Now, you can keep on burning coal and you can keep on
producing electricity with it if you use carbon capture
and sequestration. Well, they scream bloody murder. Another story about it this morning, but they say, that technology? That's not feasible. It's not technically feasible,
not economically feasible. So they need to get
their story straight, in my opinion. So the technology of CCS has been around for a long time, 50 years, and we get used to technologies
automatically getting cheaper and better, you know, with the computer chips
and the cell phones and all that. Well, University of Oxford
did a whole study, and some come down
in cost fast, some slow. A few are in a category called
non-improving technologies. And that’s where carbon
capture and storage is. 50 years, not any price decline. Well, could we get
a breakthrough in spite of that? Maybe. We're throwing a lot of money at it. We had to do that to get the compromise
that passed the IRA, and we ought to continue the research. But again, let's don't pretend
that it's here. It's not here now. And to use it as an excuse,
and now they've got another one. Now it's called direct air capture. These are giant vacuum cleaners
that use an awful lot of energy. It's technically feasible,
but it's extremely expensive. And it also uses so much energy. But it is tremendously useful. You know what it's used for? The CEO of one of the largest
oil companies in the US had told us what it's useful for. It's useful to give them an excuse
for not ever stopping oil. A few months later, she said, ""This gives us, this new technology,
a license to continue operating."" Some people call that a moral hazard. For them, the moral hazard is not a bug, it's a feature, as the old saying goes. And so let's just look,
this is state-of-the-art. It looks pretty impressive, doesn't it? This is the backside
of one of these machines. (Laughter) I had the same thought. (Laughter) Now this, they're improving this. (Applause) They're improving this. And the new model, seven years from now, each of these machines
is going to be able to capture 27 seconds' worth
of annual emissions. Woohoo. That gives them a license
to continue producing more and more oil and gas. Or so they claim. Well, they also say, the experts, that in order to be economically feasible, it has to come in
at 100 dollars a ton or less. The leading company says
that 27 years from now, it may come down below
three times that amount. So again, if this sounds
kind of incredible, it is not credible. But they're using it
in order to gaslight us, literally. But I didn't mean it as a pun,
but that's what they're using it to do. And we can't fall for it. The biggest obstacle to direct
air capture is probably physics. And what I mean by that,
they've explained this to me. CO2 makes up 0.035 percent of the air so we're going to vacuum
the other 99.96 percent to get that little bit out. Come on, really? Come on. And it doesn't even pretend
to catch the methane or the soot or the mercury
or the particulate pollution that kills 9 million people a year
around the world. And that's why the climate
justice advocates are so down on this kind of nonsense. They say, here's one of them says,
look, we need to fight climate change, but don't do it by pretending to do it
and continue dumping all this pollution on the front line communities
that are downwind from the smokestacks. And that's why they have not ever
really liked the carbon capture. And what about all
the energy that's needed? Is it going to come
from more fossil fuels? Well, in case of Occidental, yes. But could it come
from more solar and wind? Well, if so, why not use
the solar and wind to replace the fossil fuel-burning plants that are putting all that stuff
up there in the first place? Doesn't that make sense? Am I missing something? (Applause) Anyway, this is the environmental
justice advocate who is making the point that you can't do it without protecting
those who are victimized downwind from the smokestacks,
downstream from the pollution. Now, some of the companies, of course, you say we're going
to offset our emissions. And again, offsets can play
a role, a small role, five to 10 percent according
to the Science Based Targets initiative, the most authoritative source
on all of this. But, you know, Chevron
just had its offsets analyzed. It turned out 93 percent of them
were worthless and junk. And that's too often the case. It's not a get-out-of-jail-free card. And their offsets were only aimed
at 10 percent of their emissions in the first place. Eighty percent
of the fossil fuel companies just completely ignore
the Scope Three emissions, which is the main part
of their pollution problem. So they say that they
have increased by 400 percent the share of their spending on energy that goes to green technologies
and carbon capture. And yes, they have, they've increased
it all the way up to four percent. And it's not even as good as that, because if you look at the windfall
profits they've been getting, what have they done with that? Well, they gave it back
to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. So the amount of money the fossil fuel industry
is investing in renewables and carbon capture is one percent. Does that mean they are sincere actors,
working in good faith? I don't think so. A lot of people still think so. They think they're on our side. I don't think it's in their nature
to be on our side. I think they're driven by incentives
that push them in the opposite direction. But in any case, they produce no solutions
whatsoever that are scalable or remotely feasible. And again, they have actively fought against the solutions that others
have been trying to bring. I've seen it personally. Many of you have seen it personally. And it's happening all over the world. No progress. They've even gone backwards. Now, if a company says, look, we shouldn't be excluded
from the COP process, we know a lot about energy. Here's a simple test. Do they actually have, does the company have
real net-zero commitments, a genuine phase-down plan, yes or no? Are they committed to full disclosure? Yes or no? Are they going to spend
windfall profits on the transition? Yes or no? Are they committed to transparency? Will they end their anti-climate lobbying? Will they end their greenwashing? Will they be in favor
of reforming the COP process so that the petro states
don't have an absolute veto on anything the world wants
to discuss or act on? We've got to change that. In order to move faster, we have got to empower
the global community in a way that frees them
from the hammerlock that the fossil fuel companies
have on them today. And any company
that doesn't pass this test, I'm telling you, ought to be prohibited from taking
part in the COP process. (Cheers and applause) What about the company that's led
by the president of this year's COP, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company? Well, it's rated one
of the least responsible of all the oil and gas companies. It no longer even releases information on any of its emissions,
has no transition plan, no short or mid-term target scores, a pathetic three on 100-scale
on their transition plans. And the nation's plan
is rated highly insufficient. They just put out a new one,
it's still insufficient. So that's the first obstacle. Second one's a lot clearer. This one has to be removed
in order to get to the faster solutions. But in order to remove it, we've got to do something
about the second obstacle, and that is the financial system, the global allocation of capital
and the subsidies for fossil fuels. Governments last year around the world
subsidized with taxpayer money more than a trillion dollars,
subsidizing fossil fuels. That's five times larger
than the amount in 2020. Are we going in the right direction
or the wrong direction? Well, there are a lot
of good things I'll show you, but this has to stop. And the 60 largest global banks have put 5.5 trillion extra dollars into the fossil fuel companies
since the Paris agreement. And preposterously, 49 of them
have also signed net-zero pledges. So we ... Global allocation of capital. The borrowing of private
capital is ruled out for many developing countries. Nigeria has to pay an interest rate
seven times higher than Europe or the US. Political risk, corruption risk,
currency risk, off-take risk, it's rule of law risk. That's why the World Bank and the other
multilateral development banks are supposed to take
those top layers of risk off. And that's why we need
reform in the World Bank. Thank goodness so many fought
to get a new head of the World Bank, and I'm very excited about his progress. Now, when these obstacles are removed,
we can really accelerate progress. They'll still be problems, of course, but we have everything we need and proven deployment models
to reduce emissions 50 percent in the next seven years. But we will still need better grids, more resilient grids, more solar and wind, much more regenerative agriculture. That's a way to really pull
carbon out of the air. More electric vehicles
and charging stations and more energy storage. I'll show you that just
before we quit here. And more green hydrogen,
so more electrolyzers to produce it. And these are all surmountable obstacles. Already, renewables account for 90 percent of all the new electricity generation
being installed each year worldwide. Ninety-three percent solar
and wind in India last year. And of course, the solar's
taking off and so is wind and so are the electric vehicles
and battery storage. It has grown so dramatically. You’ve got to rescale the graph to look
at the trillion-dollar industry emerging. Now, just seven years ago,
there was one gigafactory. I learned from one of you
at a session a couple of hours ago and had my staff research it, there are now 195 gigafactories
and another 300 in the pipeline. So will we succeed? Some people fight
with a vulnerability to despair. You know, the old cliche, “denial
ain’t just a river in Egypt.” Despair ain’t just a tire in the trunk. There are people that are vulnerable. But let me close with what I regard
as amazingly good news. What if we could stop
the increase in temperatures? Well, if you look
at the temperature increases, if we get to true net-zero, astonishingly, global temperatures
will stop going up with a lag time of as little
as three to five years. They used to think that positive feedback
loops would keep that process going. No, it will not. The temperatures will stop going up. The ice will continue melting
and some other things will continue, but we can stop
the increase of temperatures. Even better, if we stay at true net zero,
in as little as 30 years, half of all the human-caused CO2
will come out of the atmosphere into the upper ocean
and the trees and vegetation. So young people are demanding
that we do the right thing. Do not be vulnerable to despair. We are going to do this. And if you doubt that we,
as human beings have the will to act, please always remember that the will to act
is itself a renewable resource. Thank you very much. (Cheers and applause) Thank you."

#TED #TEDTalks #unitedstates #civilwar","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'social change', 'politics', 'history', 'war', 'United States', 'Violence']",2023-08-15T04:00:34-07:00,2023-08-15T04:00:34-07:00,Science & Technology,"I'm going to talk about a threat that most people
don't want to think about. It's too frightening
and it doesn't seem real. That threat is civil war. Since 1946, over 250 civil wars have broken out and that number continues to increase. There are now almost 50 percent
more civil wars than there were in 2001. I've been studying civil wars
for over 30 years. I've interviewed members
of Hamas in the West Bank, ex-Sinn Féin members in Northern Ireland, former members of the FARC in Colombia. I've stood on top of the Golan Heights
and stared into Syria at the top of the Syrian civil war. I've driven across Zimbabwe as the military was planning
its coup against Robert Mugabe. I've been followed and interrogated
by members of Myanmar's junta. In 2017, I was asked to serve
on a task force run by the CIA called the Political
Instability Task Force. One of the goals of that task force
was to come up with a model to help the US government predict what countries around the world were likely to experience
ethnic conflict and civil war. It turns out that predicting
civil war is possible. Solid data exists on where and when
these conflicts are likely to break out. It's just that most people
don't know that. The task force was comprised
of two types of people, experts on civil war like myself
and data analysts. The experts came up
with 38 different factors that they thought could potentially
lead a country towards civil war. And some of those factors seemed obvious,
like whether a country was poor, had lots of income inequality or had a government
that heavily discriminated against one particular group. It turns out that only two factors
were highly predictive and they weren't the ones
the experts expected. The first was whether a country
was an anocracy. Anocracy is just a fancy term
for partial democracy. It's a government that's neither
fully democratic nor fully autocratic. It's something in between. So think about Hungary today. Hungary holds elections. Hungarians eagerly go out and vote. It's just that whoever
wins those elections can basically do whatever they want. The second factor was whether citizens in these anocracies
had formed political parties around identity rather than ideology. So rather than joining a party
because you were liberal or conservative, capitalist or communist, you joined a party
because you were Black or white, Christian or Muslim, Serb or Croat. If a country had these two features, the task force considered it
at high risk of political violence and put it on a watchlist. It was actually called The Watchlist and it was sent to the White House. So here I was, sitting in a hotel conference room
in suburban Virginia four times a year with a room full of really smart people. And we talked about countries in Africa,
the Middle East, Central Asia, but we never, ever talked
about the United States. That's because the CIA
is legally not allowed to monitor the United States
or its citizens. And that's exactly the way it should be. But I was a private citizen
and I had this information and I could see that both of these factors
were emerging in my own country and they were emerging
at a surprisingly fast rate. The US's democracy has been downgraded
three times since 2016. 2016, it was downgraded
because international election monitors had considered the 2016 election free,
but not entirely fair. America's own intelligence
agencies had found that the Russians had, in fact,
meddled in that election. It was downgraded again in 2019 when the White House refused to comply
with requests by Congress for information. And it was downgraded a final time at the end of 2020 when President Trump refused to accept
his loss in the 2020 election, and actively attempted
to overturn the results. Between December of 2020 and early 2021, the United States was officially
classified as an anocracy. If the task force had been allowed
to monitor and study the United States, it likely would have considered it
at high risk of political instability and political violence
in December of 2020, just a few weeks before
the January 6 insurrection. And it likely would have put
the United States on the watchlist. We also know who tends
to start civil wars. And again, it's not the people
most of us think. It is not the poorest people in society. It is not the people who are most
oppressed by their government. The people who tend to start civil wars,
especially ethnically-based civil wars, are the groups that had once been
politically dominant but are in decline. If you think back
to the former Yugoslavia. Serbs had enjoyed most of the positions
in government and the military throughout the Cold War
for decades, for decades. But they were the ones
who stood to lose the most as Yugoslavia democratized. The Serbs started that war. Iraq's Sunnis similarly enjoyed
most of the key positions in the military and in government
under Saddam Hussein. But when the United States
toppled Saddam Hussein, they also threw the Sunnis
out of their positions. It was the Sunnis who started that war. In the United States, the rise of militias has been driven primarily by white men who see America's identity
changing in ways that directly threatens their status. They were the ones who marched
on the capital on January 6. So why is this happening now? It's happening now
because of demographic change. The United States is in the midst
of a major transition from a country whose population
is majority white to a country whose population
will be majority non-white. The United States will be the first
country to go through this, but others are going to follow. Canada is likely to be next, followed by New Zealand and then the UK, and eventually all the English-speaking
countries of the world. This is likely to be especially true if climate change causes citizens
from the global South to increasingly move north. These countries are going
to be looking to the United States to see how we manage
this demographic shift. Americans can allow
this transition to tear us apart. Or we could use it to come together to show the world
how to manage this change and in the process create a truly
multiethnic, multi-religious democracy. So how do you do this? The first thing we have to do is address the two big
risk factors of civil war. Anocracy and identity politics. To address anocracy,
we have to improve the rule of law. We have to ensure equal access
to every citizen to the vote. We have to reduce corruption and we have to improve
the quality of government services. But reforming a government takes time. Those are not easy things to do
and it often seems impossible. That's exactly where
the United States is today, almost paralyzed. This is where business can come in. Thirty years ago, most of us thought that South Africa
was barreling towards civil war. Black South Africans
were increasingly protesting the brutality of the white
apartheid regime, and the government
responded with more brutality. But then something happened. The business community stepped in
and demanded real democracy. They did this because they
had been suffering under years of crushing economic sanctions and eventually they had to choose
between apartheid and profits, and they chose profits. And when they went to the government
and said, ""We will no longer support you,"" the apartheid regime
knew it could not survive and reform happened quickly. The business community
can also help address identity politics by investing in those communities
that have been left behind by globalization and by free-trade
agreements like NAFTA. In the United States, it was the working class
that disproportionately suffered. Those are the communities
that are the most angry and the most resentful today. Businesses can invest
in better health care, better education
and a higher minimum wage so that they create a group of people who are hopeful about the future and less vulnerable to the calls
by extremists to burn the system down. But there's perhaps an easier solution,
at least in the short term. At least in the short term. And that is to regulate social media, especially the algorithms that push out
the most incendiary and divisive material. I'm not saying that we should
censor free speech. Let people put whatever they
want on social media, but do not allow the algorithms to amplify the messages
by bullies and hatemongers and conspiracy theorists
and enemies of democracy. If we take away their bullhorn,
their influence will decline. I've interviewed a lot of people
who have lived through a civil war and they all say the same thing. ""I didn't see it coming."" ""I didn't see it coming."" Berina Kovac was a young mother living in Sarajevo at the beginning
of the Bosnian civil war. She told me that in the months
and weeks leading up to that war, life seemed normal. She went to work. She took weekend holidays
with her husband. They went to the weddings
of their friends. But then one night in March of 1992, when she was at home with her newborn son, the lights suddenly went out. And then she said, you started to hear machine guns. It doesn't have to be this way. We know an enormous amount
about why these terrible wars start. We know that the people intent
on violence have a playbook. We know what that playbook is. But there's no reason why we, the democracy-loving people of this world, can't create our own playbook
to prevent civil war. But to do that, we have to be brave enough
to fight for real democracy, strong democracy, because only by fighting for democracy can we ensure that we
will truly get peace. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #crispr #geneediting","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'science', 'technology', 'health', 'biology', 'bacteria', 'microbiology', 'medical research', 'microbes', 'CRISPR', 'Audacious Project', 'Jennifer Doudna']",2023-09-27T04:00:13-07:00,2023-09-27T04:00:13-07:00,Science & Technology,"The essence of being human
is that we solve problems. And when we're faced
with enormous problems like disease and climate change, we need to solve them by collaboration. I'm excited to tell you
about a new kind of collaboration that will absolutely create solutions
to these big problems. It's a collaboration that's unexpected because it's between humans and the tiniest organisms
that populate our planet: the bacteria and other microbes
that live in, on and around us. Bacteria may be small and unseen, but they often have inspired
transformative innovations, including the one that has become
the cornerstone of my own research. Over the past decade,
I've been at the forefront of developing a revolutionary
technology called CRISPR that has come from the study
of how bacteria fight viral infection. CRISPR is amazing because it allows us to precisely edit the DNA
in living organisms, including in people and plants. With CRISPR, we can change,
remove or replace the genes that govern the function of cells. This means that we now have the ability
to use CRISPR like a word processor to find, cut and paste text. CRISPR, amazingly, has already
cured people of devastating disorders like sickle cell disease, and it's created rice plants that are resistant
to both diseases and drought. Incredible, right? But the next world-changing
advance with CRISPR will actually come from using it in a way that will allow us to go to the next level by editing genes beyond
just in individual organisms. We now have the ability to use CRISPR to edit entire populations
of tiny microbes, called microbiomes, that live in and on our bodies. For decades, scientists studied bacteria
one organism at a time, as if each type of bacteria
behaved independently. But we now know that bacterial behaviors, both good and bad, result from their interactions
within complex microbiomes. In humans, dysfunctional gut microbiomes are associated with diseases as diverse
as Alzheimer's and asthma. And in farm animals,
microbiomes produce methane, a powerful contributor to climate change. But when they're healthy, both human and animal microbiomes
can actually prevent disease and reduce methane emissions. So to harness these benefits, we need a way to precisely
and reproducibly control these microbial communities. So why have microbiomes been difficult
to control in the past? It turns out that microbiomes
are very complex, and they're difficult to manipulate. Antibiotics affect the entire microbiome and their overuse
can lead to drug resistance. Diet and probiotics are nonspecific and they're often ineffective. Fecal transplants face various challenges
to both effectiveness and acceptance. (Laughter) But with CRISPR, we have a tool
that works like a scalpel. It allows us to target a particular gene
in a particular kind of cell. With CRISPR, we can change
one kind of bacterium without affecting all the others. Another challenge is that less than one
percent of the world’s microbial species have been grown and studied in the lab. Fortunately, we can now
access the other 99 percent due to the pioneering research
of my colleague, Jill Banfield, and her breakthrough technology, metagenomics, which is a tool
that allows us to figure out what species are present and what they're doing
in a microbial community. Metagenomics creates a detailed blueprint
of a complex microbiome, and that means that we can use it to figure out how to use
gene editing tools in the right gene, in the right organism. You might be wondering
how we can take this new knowledge and harness it to solve
real world problems. Well, we're bringing together
these two breakthrough technologies, metagenomics and CRISPR, to create a brand new field of science
called precision microbiome editing. This will allow us to discover links
between dysfunctional microbiomes and disease or greenhouse gas emissions. We can develop modified
and improved microbiome editors and show that they're safe and effective. And we can then begin to deploy
these optimized solutions to create the kinds of solutions
that will be transformative in the future. So how does this affect our health
and the health of our planet? We know the poorest countries and people
are the most affected by climate change, and it's a problem created
by the wealthiest people. And methane is a big part of the problem. It's been a major contributor
to rising global temperatures since preindustrial times. Specific microbiome
compositions in livestock can actually reduce
methane emissions by up to 80 percent. But doing that today currently requires
daily interventions at enormous expense, and it just doesn't scale. But with precision microbiome editing, we have an opportunity
to modify a calf's microbiome at birth, limiting that animal's impact
on the climate for its entire lifetime. And this is beneficial for farmers because reduced methane production means more efficient conversion
of feed into food. Importantly, these tools
can be used in the future to reduce methane emissions
from other sources, like landfills, wastewater
and rice paddies. Ultimately, microbiomes generate up to two-thirds of all of the methane
emissions globally. So our technology
could really move the needle in our fight against climate change. In human health, asthma affects up to 300 million
people around the world, a number that grows
by 50 percent each decade, and it disproportionately affects
lower-income children. Our team has identified a promising link between a molecule
produced in the gut microbiome and asthma development. With precision microbiome editing, we could offer a child at risk for asthma
a noninvasive therapy that would eliminate
asthma-inducing molecules, changing her life trajectory. And what's really exciting is that these same approaches
in the future could help us treat or even prevent human diseases that are linked to the gut microbiome, including obesity,
diabetes and Alzheimer's. I think it’s fascinating
that we can now use CRISPR to edit the same tiny organisms
that gave us CRISPR. In doing so, we’re collaborating
with the ultimate partner: nature. Together, we can use CRISPR-powered
precision microbiome editing to build a more resilient
future for all of us. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
QxB3b7fxMEA,coleman hughes,A Case for Color Blindness | Coleman Hughes | TED,13:21,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxB3b7fxMEA&list=UUAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug&index=79&pp=iAQB,287000,"Racial inequality provokes passionate opinions and varied ideas of how to build a fair, equitable society. One topic that's been contentiously debated for generations is color blindness: the concept that we should look beyond race when thinking about equity. In this talk, writer and podcast host Coleman Hughes makes a case in favor of the idea, sharing why he thinks the key to reducing inequality and easing racial tensions is replacing race-based policies with class-based ones.

TED welcomes a variety of perspectives on the issues that shape our world. To capture another viewpoint on the idea of color blindness, TED partnered with the nonpartisan media group Open to Debate, bringing together Coleman Hughes with New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie to debate the question: ""Does color blindness perpetuate racism?""

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'social change', 'history', 'race', 'United States', 'society', 'identity', 'policy', 'equality']",2023-08-09T08:16:42-07:00,2023-08-09T08:16:42-07:00,Science & Technology,"I want to do a quick exercise. Close your eyes. I want you to picture your best friend. Think about what specifically
you love about them. What trait makes them them? Now open your eyes. I don't know what
each of you came up with, but I'm pretty sure I know
what you didn't come up with. I’m pretty sure none of you thought, ""What makes Jim Jim is the fact
that he's six-foot-two and a redhead."" I'm guessing you chose
their inner qualities, their sense of humor, their generosity, their intelligence, qualities they would have
no matter what they looked like. There's one more quality
I'm pretty sure you didn't choose. Their race. Of all the things you could
list about somebody, their race is just about
the least interesting you can name, right down there
with height and hair color. Sure, race can be good source material
for jokes at a comedy club, but in the real world, a person's race doesn't tell you
whether they're kind or selfish, whether their beliefs are right or wrong, whether they'll become
your best friend or your worst enemy. But over the past ten years, our societies have become more
and more fixated on racial identity. We've all been invited to reflect
on our inner whiteness or inner Blackness, as if these racial essences
define who we are. Meanwhile, American society
has experienced the greatest crisis in race relations in a generation. Gallup has been asking Americans
how they feel about race relations, and this chart is the result. So as you can see, between 2001 and 2013, most Americans felt good
about race relations. Then both lines take a nosedive. It's no exaggeration to call this
one of the greatest crises of our time. And clearly we need new ways
of thinking about race if we're going to reverse this trend. So today I'm going to offer an old idea, but it's an idea that's been
widely misunderstood. You've probably heard it before,
it's called color blindness. What do I mean by color blindness? After all, we all see race. We can't help it. And what's more, race
can influence how we're treated and how we treat other people. So in that sense,
nobody is truly colorblind. But to interpret
the word colorblind so literally is to misunderstand it. Colorblind is a word like warmhearted. It uses a physical metaphor
to capture an abstract idea. To call someone warmhearted isn’t to talk
about the temperature of their heart but about the kindness of their soul. And similarly, to advocate
for color blindness is not to pretend you don't notice race. It's to support a principle that we should try our best
to treat people without regard to race, both in our personal lives
and in our public policy. And you might be thinking,
what's so controversial about that? Well, the fact is the philosophy
of color blindness is under attack. Critics say that it's naive or that we're not yet ready
for it as a society or even that it's white
supremacy in disguise. And many people agree with these feelings. For example, a few years ago, a young adult fantasy author
came under pressure to halt the release of her new book. Why? Because the marketing blurb
for the book went like this: ""In a world where the princess
is the monster, oppression is blind to skin color, and good and evil
exist in shades of gray ..."" Now that one sentence clause about oppression
being blind to skin color, describing a fantasy world, mind you, was enough to provoke an online backlash. Now, part of this reaction
to color blindness is actually a fault of its advocates. People will say things like, “I don’t see color” as a way of expressing
support for color blindness. But this phrase is guaranteed
to produce confusion because you do see color, right? I think we should all
get rid of this phrase and replace it with what
we really mean to say, which is, ""I try to treat people
without regard to race."" Now, that said, most of the pushback
to color blindness comes from critics who misrepresent it
as somehow a conservative idea. Now, this could not be further
from the truth. The philosophy of color blindness
does not come from conservatives. It actually comes from the radical wing
of the antislavery movement in the 19th century. The earliest mentions of color blindness
come from Wendell Phillips, who was the president of the American
Anti-Slavery Society and a man whose nickname
was ""abolition's golden trumpet."" He believed in immediate full equality
for Black Americans. And in 1865, he called for the creation
of a ""government colorblind,"" by which he meant the permanent end
of all laws that mention race. What about the other critiques
of color blindness? Wouldn’t color blindness render us
unable to fight racism? Wouldn't it mean getting rid of policies
like affirmative action that benefit people of color? I believe that eliminating
race-based policies does not equal eliminating policies
meant to reduce inequality. It simply means that those policies
should be executed on the basis of class instead of race. Why class over race? I'll give two reasons. First because class is almost
always a better proxy for true disadvantage than race. Imagine we picked ten Americans at random. And our task is to sort them
from least privileged on one end to most privileged on the other. Now, there's no direct
measure of privilege, so we have to choose a proxy measure. My claim here is that lining them up
by income or wealth would get us closer to achieving that task than simply lining people up by race. That's what I mean when I say
that class is usually a better proxy for disadvantage than race. And the second reason is that class-based
policies tend to be more popular and less controversial
because they don't penalize anyone for immutable biological traits. Think of policies like
need-based financial aid or the earned-income tax credit. These are policies that address inequality without anyone having to feel
the sting of racial discrimination. I want to give you an example
of a disastrous race-based policy. It was called the Restaurant
Revitalization Fund. Over 70,000 restaurants closed
in 2020 due to the pandemic, and this fund allocated 29 billion dollars
to help these restaurants. But for the first three weeks
of the program, only people of color,
women and veterans could apply. So soon after it began, white male restaurant owners sued,
alleging discrimination. A judge ruled in their favor,
and the program was stopped. But by that time, two thirds
of the money was already gone. And it wasn't just white men that got
discriminated against in this policy. Around 3,000 women and people of color
were promised money before the judge stopped the program and then unpromised that money just after. And the remaining 10 billion
then went to white men who had initially been put
at the back of the line. So the net result of this policy
was a double dose of discrimination. Initially, thousands of white men
were discriminated against and then thousands of women and people
of color were discriminated against. And it's a virtual guarantee that there are people out there
who lost their restaurant in both of those camps
because they were the wrong skin color. Can anyone really argue that a colorblind program wouldn't have
produced better results for everybody? So I just gave an example
of a disastrous race-based policy. Now, I want to give you an example of a colorblind policy
that has worked quite well. America has been struggling
with the issue of racial bias in policing for a very long time. And a solution to one aspect
of this problem is to issue tickets using traffic cameras
instead of human beings. Cops can be racially biased,
consciously or not, but traffic cameras, red light cameras
and speeding cameras can't. So you would think anyone interested
in reducing racial bias in policing would support these traffic cameras. But you'd be wrong. Some have opposed them on the grounds that they don't yield statistically equal
ticketing rates by race, and they remain illegal in many US states. So here's an example where the philosophy of color blindness
cuts through confusion like a knife. If we’re guided by color blindness, our goal should be to eliminate bias
from systems that affect people's lives wherever possible, not to manufacture statistically equal
outcomes by any means necessary. So my talk has been focused on America, but my message is really
for any key decision maker at any institution anywhere in the world. If you care about fighting racism,
embrace color blindness. Support class-based policies. Create colorblind processes
in your own world. If you're a professor, grade your students' papers
blind to their names. Think creatively about how to apply
color blindness to your life. Color blindness is the best principle
by which to govern a multiracial, multiethnic democracy. It's the best way to lower the temperature
of tribal conflict in the long run. And if we wait for the moment
when society is ready for it, we'll be waiting forever. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Coleman,
thank you for this. You know, Mellody Hobson
came to TED a few years ago, and she had a very different
message for us. She said, be color brave, not colorblind. Her argument was that being
colorblind is dangerous because it's effectively
ignoring the problem. What would you want to say to her? Coleman Hughes: Yeah. One thing I would say is, like I said, color blindness as a philosophy,
that is the goal. That's an idea that comes
from the anti-slavery movement, right? That's not an example
of ignoring the problem. That's an example
of having the best philosophy with which to address
the problem, in my view. CA: But could you argue that that dealt
with one part of the problem but in today's world, there are still many
situations where it's not enough. Take this story of an orchestra, right, an orchestra, and it's largely white. And that doesn't feel right. So they institute a policy
of color blindness where, you know, there can't be
any racial discrimination because new musicians
are auditioned behind a screen. That's colorblind. So, so far, so good. And maybe that helps. But maybe the actual situation is that the minority kids in that area just don't have access to instruments, it's just harder for them ever to get
the kind of training and stuff they need. And the orchestra needs to be taking
a lead to bring people through so that there are people in that orchestra
who can inspire the kids and so forth. CH: Yeah, so I would
propose a different -- So if I were leading that orchestra,
what I would do is I'd say, let's continue to audition
everyone behind the veil, be colorblind in that sense, and then let's separately
invest in the community so that we can get kids
instruments when they're young and then judge them
by a colorblind standard when they come to audition. See, if you rig it at this level, then you're just changing the bar
by which you would measure progress to begin with, right? So I think that is a kind of
an artificial solution, whereas we want to maintain
colorblind standards, but actually address the root
causes of the problem. (Applause) CA: Coleman, you're an incredibly
powerful voice on this issue, and I really thank you for the courage
to come here, make this case. Good luck with the book. CH: Thank you, TED."

#TED #TEDTalks #pain","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'science', 'health', 'health care', 'biology', 'brain', 'public health', 'neuroscience', 'medical research', 'pain', 'addiction', 'human body', 'drugs']",2023-09-06T04:00:07-07:00,2023-09-06T04:00:07-07:00,Science & Technology,"So if you whack your thumb with a hammer,
you think pain is in your thumb. Physicians have a more
sophisticated understanding. We know that it's an alarm
that goes, on nerves, to your spine, where it is translated to your brain,
and pain actually happens ... somewhere. It's a little vague. We actually only get
two days of pain education throughout all of medical school, so ... In fact, the only pain lecture
I remember from the '90s was in a dark room like this, after being awake for 30 hours and hungry, and finding out our noon lecture
was sponsored by OxyContin. We got pens, we got great lasagna, and they had very cool slides
that showed pain stopped by opioids. And we learned that home opioids
aren't addictive, and if you stay ahead of pain -- (Laughter) you can keep your patients pain-free. And beyond the obviously
egregious marketing, I think it was framing
""pain-free"" as the goal that has destroyed countless lives. My friend's son Christopher
started having severe abdominal pain during this ""no-pain"" era. Eventually, he was diagnosed
with a colon disease and had surgery his senior year. They sent Christopher home
with 90 OxyContin, and then 90 more, and then, as the pain
started getting faster and faster ... Uncontrolled pain is terrifying. So when his ran out and his friends'
medicine cabinets ran out, Christopher tried heroin. And Christopher Wolf lost his battle
with substance use at age 32. So did we misunderstand pain? What if pain isn’t an alarm to silence but a learning system for survival? TED pose. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Pain is every organism's primary
learning system for survival. I mean, it's like,
""Ouch. Don't touch that."" Or, to paraphrase ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Life is pain, Highness."" ""Pain-free"" was marketing, and it made physicians think
that one pill could solve pain. It still makes people feel
like you can't be happy if you have some pain, and we now know that if you want to move past
pain, it takes work. Setting the bar
at ""pain-free"" was too high. Plenty of people could have been
more comfortable, but they gave up because pain-free
was out of reach. We have really good new information
that I'm going to share, and so from now on,
I want you to think about pain as a Venn diagram, with physiology, fear and control. I'm going to tell you how each of these
can give you power over pain. Right now, I'm translating
these, in my research, into a low-back pain device
to reduce opioid use. But 20 years ago, I just wanted to have
a fast cure for needle pain, for IV access and my kids' shots. I was driving home one night
after a graveyard shift, and my hands were vibrating
on the steering wheel, because we needed
to get the tires balanced. I was ignoring that to think about pain, and when I got home
and reached for the door in my house, my hand was numb. Vibration. So I burst in, my Boy Scout husband
grabbed some frozen peas, and we had ourselves
a genuine eureka moment, where cold and vibration blocked pain. Over the next decade,
I found the right frequency to block pain, I got a grant, and I created Buzzy,
which is vibration plus ice ... in a bee shape. And you put it on your arm
when you’re getting an injection. And to date, 45 million
needle procedures had decreased pain, and over 80 randomized controlled trials,
independently, all around the world, have been published. But ... (Cheers and applause) At about 30 randomized
controlled trials in, one of my colleagues came to me and confided that he was
in opioid recovery. And he asked whether or not Buzzy
could let him get through a total knee replacement drug-free. I'd never thought about it. It's the same pain nerve
for knees as for needles, so I said maybe. And he did it. Vibration plus cold replaced OxyContin. (Applause) So at that point, I went all in,
to figure out why. And here is what we know. So the reason that vibration
decreases pain is because the physiology of the nerves of light touch, pressure,
stretching and motion all races pain to the spine. Now people have tried electricity
to trigger the light-touch nerves, but we now know
that motion, shown in green, is what's most effective
at shutting the gate on sharp pain. This is called gate control, and the exact right frequency of vibration
triggers the nerves that decrease pain. The physiology of ice is different. So the cold goes up to the brain,
where the conductor goes, ""Obnoxious, but not dangerous. I will decrease sensations
coming from everywhere."" And it decreases pain everywhere. If a child was so freaked out
from previous experiences that even the swab hurt ... physiology wasn't as helpful. So we added distraction,
like a monkey poster. And what we discovered was combining counting
plus making a decision cut pain in half. So, for example, ""How many monkeys
are actually touching the bed?"" activates the decision switchboard. I know what you guys are doing. It's five. (Laughter) Here is your pain hack
for the day, though. If you do not have monkeys on hand,
then find any sentence and count how many of the letters
have holes in them. Counting, deciding.
So, like, you've got a g-hole, o-hole, a ... hole. (Laughter) (Laughter and applause) I guarantee you
and your family will use this. (Laughter) The biggest hack, though,
is understanding why distraction works. And now, through functional MRI,
we can actually see pain happen. And it's not one place. Pain is a symphony of connections, from the sensation area to the conductor, to the decision switchboard, and then to fear, memory,
meaning, control. So if the decision switchboard
is occupied sorting monkeys, it can't notify fear and meaning, and you feel less pain. What you feel is mostly what you expect to feel. Stay with me. If you're a kid, the same punch hurts more from a bully
than from your buddy. And if you're an adult
and you feel something, the second you think it's cancer,
it hurts more and more, until you find out it's not. And those same kids
who had horrible shot experiences can tolerate all kinds of needle pain ... to look cool. (Laughter) Because it is a different context. These patterns, called connectomes, are very personal, because experiences lay down
more of the same sensation. And we now know that people who have
certain areas in the brain connected feel more pain than people
with different areas connected. And more importantly, untreated pain or intense pain
can lay down heavier connections, so that even when your body is healed,
you will still feel more pain. It's this very plasticity
and personalization which makes the physiology,
fear, control matrix so useful. Because choosing physiologic options that you can layer, that work for you, decreases pain, like heat, cold, vibration,
deep relaxation, acupuncture, capsaicin, exercise, meditation ... There's more. Christopher probably had
10 of these around his house and just didn't know it. Having control over your options
decreases pain. Deep breathing increases control. Choosing what to focus on
increases control. Fear and control
are the volume knobs for pain. Fear controls so many of our sensations,
this shouldn't be unusual, but we don't practice it for pain. So if you're home alone
and you hear a clunk ... your hearing becomes hypersensitive. But when you remember
your kid's home from college, your fear dials down
and your brain overrides it and says, ""Don't worry about it."" Saint Augustine called pain
the greatest of evil. But if it is a survival system,
it cannot be all evil. So instead, think of pain as your nagging,
safety-obsessed, exaggerating friend who’s sometimes wrong. And it’s OK to ignore
or override your friend if you know that you're safe. This takes practice. On a flight that was turbulent, I had an entire cup of scalding-hot coffee
dumped straight on my ankle. Electric jolt through my scalp. I ripped off my sock; it was already red. It was going to blister. There was no way I could get my foot
into that little sink to get cold water on it. And then I remembered. Physiology hack. I had an unopened cold beer. (Laughter) Medical-grade cold beer
went on my ankle, stat. (Laughter and applause) I had a vibrator
in my carry-on, because I would. On my ankle. And then -- (Laughter and applause) The pain kind. (Laughter) And then my fear hack. I'm like, ""There's a barf bag
that has holy letters, but I'm going to put it
in the pocket pouch and save it, because then, I have increased control."" And, pain  ,
I was no longer that concerned. (Cheers and applause) Although then, I realized I'm that guy, with my bare foot sticking out
in the aisle on a plane, with a beer on it. (Laughter) Power over pain isn’t always pretty,
but it is possible and it is absolutely critical. Because there’s one more misconception
we have not talked about. I honestly thought that opioids
turned off some pain switch. They turn on our reward system. So some people feel amazing, but most people just still feel
pain, but don't care. Now, this is a godsend for people
with chronic pain diseases. We should not take them away. And in the trauma bay, the more morphine in the first 24 hours
after a burn or a wound, the less post-traumatic stress, the less chronic pain later. But studies show
that recovery after surgery is just as well accomplished
with coaching and physiologic options. And if you're one of the people
who feel amazing with opioids, it's too risky. A study in 2019 found that one in 15 young adults who got
opioids for their wisdom tooth removal had substance-use disorder within a year. Ibuprofen works better. So what do we do? Well, in my dream world,
we have health-care systems -- paid-for options and coaching -- for Christophers everywhere. And we quit giving
double-digit prescriptions for opioids for home recovery. In the real world, 80,000 people died in the US last year
from opioid overdoses, and 80 percent of substance-use disorders
start with a pill prescribed for pain ... Usually taken from your friend's
medicine cabinet. People can’t afford options. Doctors, 20 years later,
still don't know them. But you do. You all now know to throw away
the opioids in your medicine cabinet. You now know that there are options
you can use to decrease pain, and you know that ""pain-free""
should be ditched for ""more comfortable."" And whether you dump scalding coffee or pain wakes you
and exhausts you every day ... Options that are in your control ... can allow you to reframe pain. Thank you. (Cheers and applause) Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Amy, thank you, it's amazing. So how do you think
that pain scales have set us back from this work that you're doing, and how is the NIH treating pain
and addiction differently now? Amy Baxter: So in one
of the 120 versions of this talk, I talked about
how the thing is, in the '90s, if we wanted to “disease-ify” pain, it meant we had to be able to measure it. So that was where the FACES
scales come from, and they're actually very useful
in the emergency department to tell whether or not
a medicine is working. In fact, we were one of the first ones
that showed, with sickle cell, that the patient's report,
based on those scales, was what was most indicative
of whether they needed to be admitted, rather than any biologic marker. But what we're doing now is we're using something
called the PROMIS scales, so it’s how intense pain is
on five-point scales, how much it interferes, so there's pain interference,
pain intensity. And the way we're looking at pain
is much more on the impact for the person, rather than trying to pretend there's any kind of objective
pain measurement. WPR: OK. And you mentioned that you're working
on some new applications for Buzzy, specifically for back pain. What are some of the possibilities
that we have here for what this could do for us
in the future? AB: On my tombstone,
there's going to be a vibrating bee. It's actually called DuoTherm, not Buzzy. But what we've learned
is that there are harmonics of interaction between the specific frequencies
that cancel out the pain. So there’s one particular nerve
called the Pacinian that has a very specific frequency range, and by causing them to interact, we're starting to explore
more about the pain that's coming from the fascia
between the skin and between the muscles, but that area is where we're unexplored, and so by interacting
with different frequencies and then layering heat
or cold, pressure options, giving people the choice
of so many different ways to do it, it's really engaging
all the different areas of the brain from which pain comes. WPR: Wow, OK.
Well, thank you so much, Amy. AB: Welcome. Thank you, all."

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'social change', 'personal growth', 'decision-making', 'self', 'fear', 'Life', 'Maya Shankar']",2023-07-25T08:43:55-07:00,2023-07-25T08:43:55-07:00,Science & Technology,"When I was a kid, the violin was the center of my life. I'd run home from the bus stop
after school and practice for hours. Every Saturday, my mom and I
would wake up at four in the morning to catch a train to New York
so I could study at Juliard. Here's a throwback to eight-year-old me
performing the violin. Some questionable fashion choices
from young Maya here, not going to lie. But anyway, when I was a teenager,
my musical idol, Itzhak Perlman, invited me to be his private student. And my big dream of becoming
a concert violinist felt within reach. But then one morning when I was 15, I was practicing this tricky
technical passage. I struggled to get it right, and I overextended my finger
on a single note. I heard a popping sound. I’d permanently damaged
the tendons in my hand, and my dream was over. I share this story because unexpected change
happens to all of us. An accident or an illness, a relationship that suddenly ends. Today, I'm not a violinist,
but I'm a cognitive scientist. And I'm interested in how we respond
to exactly this kind of change. I spent the past two decades
studying the science of human behavior. And today I host a podcast called
""A Slight Change of Plans"" -- (Audience cheers) glad you guys like it -- where I interview people
from all over the world about their life-altering experiences. I started this podcast because change
is scary for a lot of us, am I right? For one, it is filled with uncertainty, and we hate uncertainty. Research shows that we're more stressed when we're told we have a 50 percent
chance of getting an electric shock than when we're told we have
a 100 percent chance. It's wild, right? I mean, we'd rather be sure
that a bad thing is going to happen than to have to deal with any uncertainty. Change is also scary
because it involves loss of some kind. By definition, we're departing
from an old way of being and entering a new one. And when we experience a change that we wouldn't
have chosen for ourselves, it's easy to feel
that our lives are contracting, that were more limited than before. But when we take this perspective, we fail to account for an important fact. That when an unexpected
change happens to us, it can also inspire
lasting change within us. We become different people
on the other side of change. What we're capable of, what we value
and how we define ourselves, these things can all shift. And if we can learn to pay close attention
to these internal shifts, we may just find that rather
than limiting us, change can actually expand us. Alright, today I'm going to share with you
three questions you can ask yourself the next time life throws you
that dreaded curveball. In the moment, I know it's so easy
to focus on what you've lost. And so I'm really hoping that you can use
these questions as tools to discover all that you might gain. Alright, let’s start
with question number one. This is inspired by a conversation
I had on my podcast with a woman named Christine Ha, and it's about our capabilities. Christine was 24 when a rare autoimmune
disease left her permanently blind. At the time, she was learning to cook
the Vietnamese dishes that she had loved in childhood. But now cooking even simple
meals was tough. She told me that her
frustration peaked one day when she was making
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She struggled to align
the two slices of bread and sticky jelly dripped all over
her hands and onto the counter. She threw the sandwich into the trash, and she felt really defeated
by the limited future that she imagined for herself. Since Christine lived alone though, she had no choice but to keep at it. She remembers her delight
when she successfully cut an orange for the first time and when she scrambled an egg
without burning it. As she spent more hours in the kitchen, she realized that cooking was far more
multi-sensory than she had thought. While she couldn't see
if the garlic had browned, she could rely on the smell
and the sizzling sounds in the pan. But Christine also realized
something bigger. Something new was emerging within her. At the start of her vision loss
she had cooked just to get by. I mean, it was really
just a practical thing. But now she was thrilled
by the challenge of it all. She tackled harder and harder
recipes over the years and eventually became
the first-ever blind contestant on the TV show ""Master Chef."" And guess what? She won the entire damn thing. (Laughs) Christine's a rock star. She's an amazing, amazing person. This brings us to the first question
that you can ask yourself the next time you face
something unexpected. ""How might this change
change what you're capable of?"" When we predict how we'll respond
to any given change, we tend to imagine what our present-day
selves will be like in that new situation. Research by the psychologist Dan Gilbert
shows that we greatly underestimate how much we'll change in the future, even though we fully acknowledge
we've changed considerably in the past. Our psychology continually
tricks us into believing that who we are, right now,
in this very moment, is the person that's here to stay. But the person meeting the challenges
after an unexpected change will be different. You will be different. Today, Christine is a world-renowned chef. She goes by the nickname The Blind Cook, and she owns three restaurants in Texas. And importantly, she's really curious about what else
she can achieve without vision. These days, you can find her
snowboarding and rock climbing on the weekends. Christine shared with me something that she could never have imagined
thinking before all this. That if given the choice today, she would choose not to have
her vision restored. Though she did tell me
she'd like it back for a moment because she really wants to know
what Justin Bieber looks like. (Laughter) Alright, let's move on
to the second question. This one is about our values, and it's inspired by a conversation I had with a science journalist
named Florence Williams. One evening about five years ago, Florence and her husband were hosting
a dinner party for their friends. As she was preparing the salad,
her husband handed her his phone so that she could read
an email from a relative. But he'd mistakenly
pulled up the wrong email. What Florence saw instead was a lengthy note from her husband, confessing his love to another woman. I know. Florence’s 25-year marriage
came to an end, and she told me that she was taken aback by the physical and emotional
intensity of her heartbreak. She said it felt like she'd been plugged
into a faulty electrical socket. Since Florence is a problem
solver by nature, she instinctively saw her heartbreak
as a problem to solve and develop a year-long,
systematic plan to try and fix it. Florence tried a bunch of things. She took solo trips into the wilderness, she tried a range
of experimental therapies, She even went to the Museum
of Broken Relationships, which I promise is the thing. You name it, she tried it. But by the end of the year, none of these remedies
had healed her broken heart. And so Florence had no choice but to entertain
a new philosophy altogether. Maybe a broken heart
was not a problem to solve. And maybe closure wasn't the answer. Research by the psychologist
Dacher Keltner shows that when we reduce our need
for what's called cognitive closure, the desire to arrive at clear
and definitive answers, our capacity to feel joy
and beauty expands. Florence told me that when she freed
herself from this goal-oriented mindset, a mindset, by the way,
that she had valued for so much of her life
up until this point, she began to find unexpected
delight in the unknown. This leads us to the second question
you can ask yourself the next time you face
something unexpected. How might this change
change what you value? The unexpected implosion
of Florence's marriage has permanently shifted the way
that she sees her life. From a puzzle in need of solutions to a more serendipitous path of discovery. Now, when Florence goes hiking, she's just as likely to sit still,
feeling the breeze, as she is to try and make the summit. She no longer makes five-year plans. And she's comfortable not knowing
all the answers around her heartbreak. By the way, I was texting
with Florence the other day, and she's currently in a very
happy relationship. If her ex-husband is listening to this,
I just want him to know she's doing great, buddy. (Laughter) Alright, now on to question number three. This one is about how we define ourselves. It's about our self-identities. And it comes from my personal story
of change with the violin. When my injury took
the violin away from me, I found myself grieving
not just the loss of the instrument, but also the loss of myself. For so long, the violin had defined me, that without it, I wasn't sure
who I was or who I could be. I felt stuck. I'd later learned that this phenomenon
is known as identity paralysis. It happens to a lot of us
when we face the unexpected. Who we think we are and what we're about
is suddenly called into question. But I since realized
that there was something different, something more stable that I could
have anchored my identity to. And this brings us to that third
and final question. How might this change
change how you define yourself? When I re-examine
my relationship with the violin, I discovered that what I really missed
wasn't the instrument itself, but the fact that music
had given me a vehicle for connecting emotionally with others. I remember as a little kid
playing for people and feeling kind of awestruck that we might all feel
something new together. What this means for me today is that I no longer anchor
my identity to specific pursuits like being a violinist
or a cognitive scientist or a podcaster. Instead, I anchor my identity
to what lights me up about those pursuits, what really energizes me. And for me, it's a love
of human connection and understanding. I now define myself not by what I do, but why I do it. Look, unexpected change comes for us all,
whether we like it or not. And when it does, it can really suck. But I'm hoping that if we can stay open
to how we might internally change, how we might expand, it can help us weather the storm. Life recently threw me
a new slight change of plans. I've always wanted to be a mom, but becoming one has been difficult and my husband and I
have had to navigate pregnancy losses and other heartbreaks over the years. And now I'm not sure what will happen. But I'm using these three questions
to help me during this tough time. I'm asking myself
how this unexpected challenge might change what I'm capable of, what I value, and how I define myself. I'm still figuring things out. But what I can tell you right now is that I'm imagining a future me who is expanding her definition
of what it means to parent. Who's perhaps finding what she craved
from motherhood in other places. At a minimum, this exploration has allowed me to loosen my grip on the identity
of Mom just a bit. And I found it freeing. I'm beginning to see change
with more possibility. And I'm hoping you can, too. Thank you so much. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #ai","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'science', 'technology', 'AI', 'Elizer Yudkowsky', 'machine learning']",2023-07-11T10:20:26-07:00,2023-07-11T10:20:26-07:00,Science & Technology,"Since 2001, I have been working
on what we would now call the problem of aligning artificial
general intelligence: how to shape the preferences and behavior of a powerful artificial mind
such that it does not kill everyone. I more or less founded the field
two decades ago, when nobody else considered it
rewarding enough to work on. I tried to get this very important
project started early so we'd be in less
of a drastic rush later. I consider myself to have failed. (Laughter) Nobody understands how modern
AI systems do what they do. They are giant, inscrutable matrices
of floating point numbers that we nudge in the direction
of better performance until they inexplicably start working. At some point, the companies
rushing headlong to scale AI will cough out something
that's smarter than humanity. Nobody knows how to calculate
when that will happen. My wild guess is that it will happen
after zero to two more breakthroughs the size of transformers. What happens if we build
something smarter than us that we understand that poorly? Some people find it obvious
that building something smarter than us that we don't understand might go badly. Others come in with a very wide range
of hopeful thoughts about how it might possibly go well. Even if I had 20 minutes for this talk
and months to prepare it, I would not be able to refute
all the ways people find to imagine that things might go well. But I will say that there is no
standard scientific consensus for how things will go well. There is no hope
that has been widely persuasive and stood up to skeptical examination. There is nothing resembling a real
engineering plan for us surviving that I could critique. This is not a good place
in which to find ourselves. If I had more time, I'd try to tell you
about the predictable reasons why the current paradigm will not work to build a superintelligence
that likes you or is friends with you,
or that just follows orders. Why, if you press ""thumbs up""
when humans think that things went right or ""thumbs down"" when another AI system
thinks that they went wrong, you do not get a mind
that wants nice things in a way that generalizes well
outside the training distribution to where the AI is smarter
than the trainers. You can search for ""Yudkowsky
list of lethalities"" for more. (Laughter) But to worry, you do not
need to believe me about exact predictions
of exact disasters. You just need to expect that things
are not going to work great on the first really serious,
really critical try because an AI system
smart enough to be truly dangerous was meaningfully different
from AI systems stupider than that. My prediction is that this ends up with us
facing down something smarter than us that does not want what we want, that does not want anything we recognize
as valuable or meaningful. I cannot predict exactly how a conflict
between humanity and a smarter AI would go for the same reason I can't predict
exactly how you would lose a chess game to one of the current top
AI chess programs, let's say Stockfish. If I could predict exactly
where Stockfish could move, I could play chess that well myself. I can't predict exactly
how you'll lose to Stockfish, but I can predict who wins the game. I do not expect something actually smart
to attack us with marching robot armies with glowing red eyes where there could be a fun movie
about us fighting them. I expect an actually smarter
and uncaring entity will figure out strategies
and technologies that can kill us quickly
and reliably and then kill us. I am not saying that the problem
of aligning superintelligence is unsolvable in principle. I expect we could figure it out
with unlimited time and unlimited retries, which the usual process of science
assumes that we have. The problem here is the part
where we don't get to say, “Ha ha, whoops, that sure didn’t work. That clever idea that used to work
on earlier systems sure broke down when the AI
got smarter, smarter than us.” We do not get to learn
from our mistakes and try again because everyone is already dead. It is a large ask to get an unprecedented scientific
and engineering challenge correct on the first critical try. Humanity is not approaching
this issue with remotely the level of seriousness
that would be required. Some of the people leading these efforts have spent the last decade not denying that creating a superintelligence
might kill everyone, but joking about it. We are very far behind. This is not a gap
we can overcome in six months, given a six-month moratorium. If we actually try
to do this in real life, we are all going to die. People say to me at this point,
what's your ask? I do not have any realistic plan, which is why I spent the last two decades trying and failing to end up
anywhere but here. My best bad take is that we need
an international coalition banning large AI training runs, including extreme
and extraordinary measures to have that ban be actually
and universally effective, like tracking all GPU sales, monitoring all the data centers, being willing to risk
a shooting conflict between nations in order to destroy
an unmonitored data center in a non-signatory country. I say this, not expecting
that to actually happen. I say this expecting that we all just die. But it is not my place
to just decide on my own that humanity will choose to die, to the point of not bothering 
to warn anyone. I have heard that people
outside the tech industry are getting this point
faster than people inside it. Maybe humanity wakes up one morning
and decides to live. Thank you for coming to my brief TED talk. (Laughter) (Applause and cheers) Chris Anderson: So, Eliezer, thank you
for coming and giving that. It seems like what you're raising
the alarm about is that like, for this to happen, for an AI
to basically destroy humanity, it has to break out, escape controls
of the internet and, you know, start commanding actual
real-world resources. You say you can't predict
how that will happen, but just paint one or two possibilities. Eliezer Yudkowsky:
OK, so why is this hard? First, because you can't predict exactly
where a smarter chess program will move. Maybe even more importantly than that, imagine sending the design
for an air conditioner back to the 11th century. Even if they -- if it’s enough
detail for them to build it, they will be surprised
when cold air comes out because the air conditioner will use
the temperature-pressure relation and they don't know
about that law of nature. So if you want me to sketch
what a superintelligence might do, I can go deeper and deeper into places where we think there are predictable
technological advancements that we haven't figured out yet. And as I go deeper, it will get
harder and harder to follow. It could be super persuasive. That's relatively easy to understand. We do not understand exactly
how the brain works, so it's a great place to exploit
laws of nature that we do not know about. Rules of the environment, invent new technologies beyond that. Can you build a synthetic virus
that gives humans a cold and then a bit of neurological change
and they're easier to persuade? Can you build your own synthetic biology, synthetic cyborgs? Can you blow straight past that to covalently bonded
equivalents of biology, where instead of proteins that fold up
and are held together by static cling, you've got things that go down
much sharper potential energy gradients and are bonded together? People have done advanced design work
about this sort of thing for artificial red blood cells
that could hold 100 times as much oxygen if they were using tiny
sapphire vessels to store the oxygen. There's lots and lots
of room above biology, but it gets harder and harder
to understand. CA: So what I hear you saying is that these terrifying
possibilities there but your real guess is that AIs will work
out something more devious than that. Is that really a likely
pathway in your mind? EY: Which part? That they're smarter
than I am? Absolutely. CA: Not that they're smarter, but why would they want
to go in that direction? Like, AIs don't have our feelings of
sort of envy and jealousy and anger and so forth. So why might they go in that direction? EY: Because it's convergently implied
by almost any of the strange, inscrutable things that they
might end up wanting as a result of gradient descent on these ""thumbs up""
and ""thumbs down"" things internally. If all you want is to make tiny
little molecular squiggles or that's like, one component
of what you want, but it's a component that never saturates,
you just want more and more of it, the same way that we would want
more and more galaxies filled with life and people living happily ever after. Anything that just keeps going, you just want to use more
and more material for that, that could kill everyone
on Earth as a side effect. It could kill us because it doesn't want
us making other superintelligences to compete with it. It could kill us because it's using up
all the chemical energy on earth and we contain some
chemical potential energy. CA: So some people in the AI world worry
that your views are strong enough and they would say extreme enough that you're willing to advocate
extreme responses to it. And therefore, they worry
that you could be, you know, in one sense, a very destructive figure. Do you draw the line yourself
in terms of the measures that we should take
to stop this happening? Or is actually anything
justifiable to stop the scenarios you're talking
about happening? EY: I don't think that ""anything"" works. I think that this takes state actors and international agreements and all international agreements
by their nature, tend to ultimately be backed by force on the signatory countries
and on the non-signatory countries, which is a more extreme measure. I have not proposed that individuals
run out and use violence, and I think that the killer argument
for that is that it would not work. CA: Well, you are definitely not
the only person to propose that what we need is some kind
of international reckoning here on how to manage this going forward. Thank you so much
for coming here to TED, Eliezer. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #metaverse #web3","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED']",2023-08-29T04:00:23-07:00,2023-08-29T04:00:23-07:00,Science & Technology,"You've all seen the bombastic headlines. ""The metaverse is dead."" But is it actually true? I was certainly alarmed
by the media reporting on the alleged demise of the industry
in which I'm so involved in. So I thought I'd check in
on the metaverse, see how it was doing. The metaverse is very young, after all,
and we should keep an eye on it. And what I found was that the metaverse
was very much the same metaverse as last I checked, except it had grown
bigger and more impactful. I saw a place where millions of people
who had been financially excluded find employment and real
economic opportunities. I saw a place where participants,
either singly or in groups, formed complex systems
that very much resembled the workings of modern
capitalist societies. I saw a place last year
that generated over 30 billion dollars of economic activity and had treasuries maintained
by those same communities to the tune of 12 billion dollars. Now, let's put that
a little bit in context. The metaverse has reserves just below that of the fiscal
reserves of New Zealand and greater economic activity
than the GDP of Cyprus, Iceland and 100 other countries. The metaverse seems to be doing OK, but this may not be quite the metaverse
that you're thinking of. You might be thinking of the metaverse as this 3D virtual-reality immersive space
with additional sensory stimulation. No, what I'm talking about
is the open metaverse, powered by web3 and blockchain. The treasuries that I'm referring to are the treasuries of DAOs. Twelve billion dollars
within control of its communities without any central authority. The banking system underlying
the open metaverse is DeFi. You might have heard
of decentralized finance before, but you may not have known that it is part and parcel
of the open metaverse. All of this open metaverse
is powered by blockchain and comprises part
of what we describe as web3, which we firmly believe will be
the future iteration of the internet, which is currently still mostly
in the web2 stage. To access the open metaverse,
you don't need fancy VR goggles, you just need plain old boring 2D screens. And you can enter a rich, thriving universe
of capitalist economic societies that have virtual worlds,
businesses, enterprises, experiences with millions of digital citizens. Our lives already have
a very strong virtual component. In Asia, where I live, we spend over nine hours a day online. That is most of our waking hours. And perhaps for most of us, just think about what it is you do
the first thing in the morning. But in this virtual reality, we are like serfs, toiling
on the lands of medieval lords. We have no ownership,
no rights to speak of. Our digital existence can be removed
on any of these platforms at a moment's notice
without any due process. Whenever we are online, we accrue value to networks
that don't belong to us. We are farmed for our time,
attention and creativity and in so doing, generate
large quantities of data. And data is the most
valuable of resources. For starters, it's powering all of the AI that we've been hearing so much about. No data, no ChatGPT, no self-driving cars. The entire foundation of the AI industry
is built on top of our data. And not just AI. Every industry covets our data. Data is the new labor. And we're not being fairly
compensated for it. We create it, but it is exclusively owned
by the publishers and platforms today. That is a world of web2 we live in today, but web3 and blockchain can change that because unlike web2, we can now finally have
true digital ownership. Ownership of things gives us
corresponding economic freedoms. The freedom to transact,
to do with as we please. It also allows us to partake
in all the network effects related to the ownership of these things. Think about all the businesses
that have been created just because we own things, such as the cars we have,
houses we live in, or even the phones. Ownership also speaks to our identity. We buy and purchase things
because of what it means to us. Self expression,
ownership of these things, such as fashion, jewelry, and yes, even NFTs. A lot of people struggle
with web3 and NFTs because they see the prices
at the higher end of things. They look at this bored ape and say, ""How can this be more valuable
than this Birkin bag, which is an actual, real item?"" But people don't buy this Birkin bag
because they want to put stuff in it. (Laughter) Ninety-nine percent of its value
is entirely virtual network effects upheld by the community
of Birkin bag lovers who find them desirable and valuable. Its utility is a very distant second. And this is perhaps true for almost
everything that we purchase in the real world. Owning the story, owning a part of the culture, being a part of the community
that forms part of our identity is why we buy things. The same is true for the open metaverse. Ownership, identity, culture and community are far more important
considerations for most of us than just its utility. And if this still feels far-fetched
to you, consider this. Last year, the video game industry generated
over 100 billion dollars of sales in virtual goods. And the fun fact is that all
of the things that they purchased were predominantly cosmetic
and whimsical in nature. Skins, trinkets, decorative items. Things that make
your virtual identities shine. Just ask your kids what they want
for the next presents. But everything you purchase
in those worlds in video games today, we don't own. That's 100 billion dollars
of rental goods. NFTs can change that because now we can
actually own these virtual goods. When you own an NFT,
such as virtual land in the metaverse, you become a stakeholder. You become an owner. Any time you own an asset in web3, it represents a stake in that network
that you wish to participate in. Imagine every time you shared
something on Instagram, for value you generated, you would receive
a small stake in the network that would be that social network. Think of the open metaverse
as the construction of new economies and new societies with a strong foundation
of digital property rights. This presents us
with a remarkable opportunity to shift away from this current form
of shareholder capitalism that has left so many people behind, to this newer form
of stakeholder capitalism in which every participant
can now also become an owner. This, to me, is what tokenization
and web3 is all about. That is the meaning of the open metaverse. Tokenization is perhaps also the best way in which we can protect
our digital intellectual property rights. When Getty Images sued
the creators of Stable Diffusion, they did so because they could tell
that they were using their images to train their AI models. But they could only do so
because Stable Diffusion was sloppy. You could see the Getty Images watermark
all over the generated images. (Laughter) Most of us won't be so lucky. Blockchain can help solve the provenance
of our digital property and lay the foundation
of protecting our rights. In this web3 future, all of us can get to earn and own
a piece of the equity on these networks
that we construct and grow. All the data that we generate today ... should be paying us an income. And all the other benefits
that property rights may bring. That is why web3 is so often described
as the internet of ownership. And ownership has always been
a key pillar to prosperity. There is a clear correlation
between property rights and the wealth of nations. Countries such as Canada and the US that enjoy strong property rights have very high GDPs, high wealth, strong entrepreneurial
and capitalist activities compared to those countries
that have very low property rights, that tend to have low GDPs and also tend to be
the poorest in the world. Countries with strong property rights also have correspondingly
much higher freedoms. True digital property rights provides us with a chance
to create a fairer, more inclusive form of capitalism. One that can still provide
all the incentives to help entrepreneurship
and innovation flourish, as capitalism has done
for centuries before. This can already be seen
in the digital context. Last year, NFTs generated
over 24 billion dollars of sales. The majority of that went to the creators
and owners of these NFTs. Web2 platforms, such as Spotify, paid only a third of that
to its creators in that same year. George Washington famously wrote, ""Freedom and property rights
are inseparable. You can't have one without the other."" The same is true for the virtual realm. In order to ensure our digital freedom, that we not be slaves to either platforms or any of the future AIs, we must also have true
digital property rights. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'scienec', 'sustainability', 'energy', 'natural resources', 'Countdown', 'renewable energy', 'Ramón Méndez Galain']",2023-10-02T04:00:05-07:00,2023-10-02T04:00:05-07:00,Science & Technology,"I'm very grateful for being here
to share with you that I live in a country, Uruguay, where about 98 percent of its electricity is obtained from a combination
of different renewable sources. A country whose inhabitants emit
30 times less greenhouse gases than the world average
for each kilowatt hour consumed. A country that produces
its electricity at a fixed cost, regardless of wars
or other geopolitical events since it is almost independent
on energy commodities, dependent just on its wind, its sun, its water, its biomass waste. A country that exports renewable energy
surpluses to its two giant neighbors, Argentina and Brazil. When I tell people about Uruguay,
they usually say two things. ""I never heard about this.
How did you do it?"" And, ""Can this be replicated elsewhere?"" So today I want to tell you what happened
in Uruguay, how we did it. And yes, even if every country would have to define
its own transition journey, the Uruguayan solution can definitely
be replicated elsewhere. Fifteen years ago, the Uruguayan
energy sector was going to a deep crisis. Economy was growing
in unprecedented rates and poverty was decreasing,
which was so great, of course, but at the same time, energy demand was growing rapidly,
which was not so great. Uruguay has no proven reserve
for fossil fuels. We have already used our large rivers
to install hydropower plants and our two big neighbors
were having their own difficulties to supply internal demand, so it was not easy for them to help us. In dry years, when you have to import
much more fossil fuels, we were forced to import electricity
from our neighbors at extraordinary prices. Cost overruns could be
as high as one billion dollars. And for a small economy like Uruguay, this is two percent of its GDP. And worse still, we were beginning
to have blackouts. We were living the perfect storm. But crisis is also opportunity. For most of my life, I was a scientist,
a particle physicist, doing research on subjects far removed
from the everyday world. But in that particular national
energy context, I saw the need to reinvent myself, to get involved
in the search for solutions. I began to study the energy issue,
to organize seminars, to discuss with different experts, and I realized how complex
the energy issue is, how many dimensions it has. Technological and economical
dimensions, of course, but also environmental,
social, geopolitical, cultural and even ethical dimensions. I started to write down my thoughts
and almost without realizing, I ended up with a comprehensive,
holistic proposal focused on a just transition
to renewable energies with very ambitious goals. And one day, when I was in my office at university, I received an unexpected call. My proposal had reached the president
and he was inviting me to implement it. Imagine my surprise. He was inviting me
to be the political head of our national energy agency, what in the United States
would be a Secretary of Energy. I accepted, and we immediately began
to implement that policy. But before the result could be fully seen,
there was an election. Fortunately, the new
president, José Mujica, was supportive of what
we had started to do and he asked me to remain in office. But he asked me one important point: to make this policy to be accepted
by all political parties. Patiently, we negotiated with all parties
represented in Parliament and we achieved our goal after
they accepted some minor changes. Having a long-term policy backed by the entire
Uruguayan political system was crucial to make rapid progress. In just five years, we went from a traditional
hydrothermal power mix with up to 50 percent fossil share to an almost completely decarbonized one that already in 2017
was 98 percent renewable. What makes the
Uruguayan case unique is that almost half of that electricity is obtained from non-traditional
renewable sources. Wind, solar and sustainable biomass. Wind alone can produce up to 40 percent
of the total electricity consumed in the country in a year, a percentage comparable to the other
world wind champion, Denmark. But also 15 or even 20 percent
of our electricity is obtained with sustainable biomass. Uruguay is an agro-industrial country
with abundant organic waste that has a lot of energy content
like rice husks, bagasse, black liquors from pulp mills. They have now ceased to be
an environmental liability to become an energy asset. Of course, none of this was easy. We have to innovate. We have to understand
that such a power system requires the planning and operation quite different
than the traditional one. Our academics worked for years
to design a groundbreaking software to handle energy dispatch, specifically designed to manage
intermittent sources such as wind and solar,
but also how to use water. This model is based on the probability of occurrence of different
weather scenarios based on both a century
of historical data and weather forecast. This allows us, for example, to have a prediction of the amount
of wind electricity and solar electricity that we're going to have in the grid
with a week in advance. And this also allows us to know how and when we have to use
water from the dams. Thanks to this disruptive methodology, today in Uruguay,
intermittent sources are king. The total installed capacity
of wind plus solar is of the order of the total
country's peak demand. This means that when we have
enough wind and solar, almost 100 percent of electricity
is just from these two sources alone, in addition to biomass-fired power plant. And this may happen many times
during the course of a week. And in those moments,
we don't use water from the dams. Hydropower plant only comes into play
when the sun goes down or when the wind falls. Our insurance policy,
when all else fails, are gas turbines, combined cycle and engine power plant. Yes, of course, flexible fossil-fired power
plants remain there, but we rely on them very little
over the course of a year, allowing non-renewable electricity
to be no more than two percent of the electricity in the grid
in a regular year, and sometimes six or seven percent
in a very dry one. And get this. We achieve this goal without
any single battery storage, water pumping or any modern technology
for electricity storage. Uruguay has shown
that the power mix can work almost exclusively thanks
to the complementarity of different renewable sources independently of their
individual intermittency. And this is perhaps the time
for you to ask the question, “And what happened to the economy? How much did all this cost?” And the answer is even more radical. The cost was negative,
if I may put it this way. In fact, we get an impressive
positive impact to our economy. To begin with, the total cost to produce
electricity all over a year was reduced by almost half. No surprise, renewable energies
are the cheapest option today. We went from about 1.1 billion dollar cost to only 600 million dollars today. And this impressive
500 million dollars every year for a country like Uruguay is huge. It's one percent of its GDP. Just for comparison,
one percent of United States GDP, it's about 250 billion dollars annually. Moreover, those tremendous cost overruns
that we had in dry years, well, they virtually disappeared. We went from cost overruns
of about one billion dollars, to only 100 to perhaps 200 million a year in very dry ones. Surprisingly enough now, though, to have much more
natural sources in the grid, because of their complementarity, we are much less dependent
on weather variability. Of course, achieving this tremendous
cost reduction was not easy either. We have to innovate also on that. We have to understand that renewable energies
require a business model quite different from the traditional one of the power sectors all over the world. We have to create a new market model. Our present business model
is based on long-term contracts derived from auction processes in which the percentage
of this source is predetermined using an optimization model that defines which is the best
technical complementarity between sources in order to minimize
the overall cost of the system. Thanks to this, nowadays, almost 100 percent
of our electricity generation is under contract, leaving almost no space
for the spot market and also no space for uncertainties. The comprehensive model
we had defined and put in place not only allows us to strongly
reduce the overall costs, but also to stabilize it over time. The cost to produce electricity
in Uruguay today is stabilized. Think it is almost independent
of the fluctuation of the prices of energy commodities. Thanks to this, for example, the Uruguayan electric mix
was barely affected by the tragic war in Europe. We had no supply
nor affordability difficulties. But the positive economic impact
of this transformation went far beyond just the electric sector. We achieved a tremendous
impact to our economy. We received six billion
dollars in investment. This is 12 percent of our GDP. Imagine the impact to our economy. New knowledge, new industrial,
entrepreneurial capabilities, 50,000 jobs were created. This seems small, perhaps for you, but for a country with only
3.4 million inhabitants, it represents three percent
of its labor force. Once again, if we were made
to make a comparison, three percent of the United
States labor force is several million new jobs created. So I told you a little about what happened
in Uruguay and how we did it. But you may be thinking,
“OK, but that’s Uruguay, fine, but that's Uruguay. It's a small country. They have a unique culture. They have hydro. Can this be reproduced elsewhere?” So I want to be very emphatic on this. Although each country will have to define
its own transition process, the vast majority of countries can make
a process similar to the Uruguayan one. (Applause) You don't necessarily need a lot of hydro
backup capacity, but for sure, you need to put much more
flexibility to your system with a new dispatch model, a new market model. But if you have people and companies
doing research and developing AI and artificial intelligence and rockets, developing a new market model,
a new energy management, shouldn't be that hard. By doing this, we will probably not get the fossil
share down to two percent, but for sure it will be below 15
or even 20 percent and in many countries, 
much less than that. And you know what,
for the last couple of years after leaving the government, I've been working in a number of countries from Dominican Republic to Chile and many other countries
in Latin America, but also in Europe, and other regions. And the good news is that the Uruguayan solution can work
in different national and energy context. But for that, there is one
special ingredient. You need to have a strong leadership and a strong political will
to move forward. And for that, it's mostly recommended to build
a broad political agreement that transcends the administration
in office in order to be sure that the transition will continue in time. What is then the most important
message for you today? It is very simple. That renewables are no longer
just a solution for the climate crisis. Renewables allow us to build strong,
reliable, robust power systems. They allow us to sharply reduce
and stabilize the electricity costs, while at the same time
having an important energy boost to our economies and job creation. Lessons learned from the Uruguayan case are that renewable energies
are ripe to provide not just a climate solution
on a global scale, but also substantial socio-economic
benefits at a local level. And this can and should happen now. There's no reason to wait until 2040, not even 2030. Now. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

#TED #TEDTalks #population","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'global issues', 'economics', 'social change', 'health care', 'future', 'aging', 'humanity', 'society', 'immigration', 'Jennifer D. Sciubba']",2023-10-03T14:17:52-07:00,2023-10-03T14:17:52-07:00,Science & Technology,"Astronomers tell us
that when we look to the night sky, we're actually looking back in time. Light from those faraway stars
takes so long to reach our eyes here on Earth, that by the time we wish
upon a particular star, it may no longer even exist. I'm here to tell you
the population of Earth is a lot like those stars. In parts of the globe, the human population is already,
or will soon be, shrinking. I know what you're thinking. And yes, total population is still
growing from eight billion today to a peak of probably nine or 10 billion. But when we track total increase, we're looking at the star
that seems to be shining brightly, but in actuality has already imploded. And that’s because there’s a difference
between what’s happening on the surface -- which is obvious total growth -- 
and the tectonic forces beneath. Since the 1960s, world population
has more than doubled, but the growth rate has been
falling the entire time. We're witnessing the most
fundamental shift to take place in modern human history. The shift towards pervasive
and permanent low fertility, population aging
and eventual depopulation. Fertility is down everywhere, just at different rates
in different places. If fertility stays the same
as it is today, just hold still, by the end of this century, China's population will be less
than half of its current size. It's a loss of 800 million people. South Korea's will be down by 63 percent, Poland's and Japan's by half, Italy's and Thailand's by 44 percent, Eastern Europe by 40 percent. Even greater number of countries
are already aging. Again, just 20 years ago, if we'd lined up everyone
in Japan or Italy or Germany from the youngest person to the oldest and we ask that person
in the middle their age, they would have been 40 years old. Today, the populations of Thailand,
Kuwait and Cuba are just as old, with Chile, Iran and Vietnam close behind. And even India, as it seems to be this bright star, assuming the throne
as world's most populous country, has below-replacement fertility. The number of young people
entering into India's workforce has already peaked. People are the foundation
of everything in a society. We're the workers and the voters and the soldiers and the caregivers. So how many of us there are
and who we are, that matters. We're on track for there
to be more people over age 60 than under the age of 14
by the middle of this century. That radical shift in modern human society presents us with a world of possibilities. Our demography is our destiny, yes, but how we react to that demography
is not preordained. What possible worlds might we create if we thoughtfully plan for an older, smaller population? In one possible world, we put our heads in the sand and keep going
about our business as usual. We have seen most societies react
like they're living in this world and throw money at people
to have more babies. But it doesn't work. South Korea has spent 210 billion dollars over the last 16 years
trying to raise fertility and they keep hitting record lows,
under one child per woman on average. In this status quo world, we keep the same economic models
that assume infinite population growth and amass more debt
to pay for our public spending. Our social safety nets stay the same, which, those rely on more
inputs from workers than withdrawals from retirees. That's what we call
a pay-as-you-go system. Western Europe is already struggling
to keep these systems afloat because in many of those countries there are only two workers
for every retiree. You can see how top heavy
the population's age structure is here and how in the next few years
it will grow even more so that way. In a status quo world, the world's most powerful countries
continue to increase military spending and try to project power
beyond their borders, even as their national budgets strain and the recruiting pool
for soldiers shrinks. Hello, Russia, China,
and maybe even the United States. So what results from failing to adapt
and clinging to the status quo? Systems overload and break. We have higher labor costs
which lead to inflation and that just makes it even more
expensive to have children. Social security systems go bankrupt and we lose the gains we've made
in reducing old-age poverty. But a head in the sand world
isn't as bad as a fearful one. In a fearful world, the ability to choose
how many children to have and when to have them gets taken away. Something that's easier
in less democratic settings. And not good news here either. Twenty years ago, almost all of our aging
countries were democracies. Now, a quarter of them, those with median ages
of 35 or higher, aren't free. And I know we see this idea
of coercion in science fiction, but it's not just science fiction. In 1965, when Nicolae Ceaușescu
took the helm in Romania and he wanted more Romanian babies, he forced it to happen
through invasive measures. Fertility temporarily spiked, but not without dire consequences
for women and for those children, many of whom were abandoned to orphanages. In a fearful world, immigration becomes more restricted. There's more hatred and division as majority groups fear being replaced
by people who don't look like them. There’s less global cooperation
as aging, shrinking countries, they lose the willingness and ability to think about causes
outside their borders and fund those. We can't come together
on pandemics or climate change or other transboundary issues. Does any of this sound familiar? I actually don't think
we're fully in this world yet, even if way too much of this
hits close to home. But I can imagine how we might get there if we aren't proactive
to shape the world we want. And what kind of world would we want? Well, in a resilient world, we compete to attract talent
from across the globe and set aside our nationalist tendencies. A shrinking world is in our future, but obviously some places
are much closer than others. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, fertility is still high enough
that each generation is twice the size of the one before it. Those young and growing populations
can be a tremendous resource for their national economies if we have investments
in human capital and other policies that can help these countries
reap a demographic dividend. And they can be a resource
for the global economy too. I mean, the US and Canada, they stand out as still growing despite
below replacement fertility in both. And in fact, Canada had record
population growth last year, 96 percent of which
was due to immigration. Theirs aren't the only
models for immigration and there are obvious trade-offs
to opening your borders. But no one said this would be easy. And speaking of things not being easy,
we're going to have to work longer. Me too. You too. And that's because in nearly half
of economies that the OECD tracks, fewer than 10 percent of people
over the age of 65 still work. That is not going to fly
in a resilient world. But in a resilient world, we've rethought what work
looks like at older ages, and we strategically leverage technology
to maximize our productivity. And we can work longer
because we're healthier. In a resilient world, we finally realize
that investing in health is a much better use of time and resources than trying to dictate population size. Similarly, in a resilient world,
we've put in place policies, incentives and technologies that recognize how we consume
is just as important as how many of us consume. And the environment is healing. In a resilient world, those societies closer to the start
of this demographic transition take advantage of the time to plan
and institute sustainable systems in the face of their demographic change. This is important because for the population ages 60 plus to go from 15 percent
of the total to 30 percent, it'll take Ireland 92 years, the United Kingdom 89 years, and Germany 70 years. For that same demographic
shift to happen now, it'll take India 34 years, Mexico 32, Iran 20 and Thailand, only 19. It's happening faster now. And we really need to realize this
because those countries have to act, including suites of policies
like moving away from informal economies that increase the risk
of poverty in older ages. You know, there are so many people
on the planet right now just between the ages of 65 and 74, that altogether they'd be the third
most-populous country in the world. There's far more of them
than there are global migrants, which we don't hear about, right? And there'll be 800 million of them
by the middle of this century. They're a vast untapped resource
in most places in the world right now, but a well-utilized one
in a resilient world and to mutual benefit. We should run from a fearful world
and get our heads out of the sand. And we should be able to imagine
a much better, more resilient world. I've always thought that the way we feel
about population aging to a large extent reflects
the really negative way we feel about our individual aging. And that bias has held us back. But just as with our own aging,
this shift is inevitable. So what are we going to do about it? As individuals, we know that our actions now set us up
to live longer, healthier, more financially secure lives. Our society's actions set us up for one of these three worlds
to become our reality. Let's make it a resilient world
and reimagine a grayer, smaller world as a beautiful one. Thank you. (Applause)"

what this really could look like. Swarms of lethal drones
with facial recognition that know your every move. Or unmanned armed robots
that are near impossible to defeat. Autonomous fighter jets
that can travel at supersonic speeds and can withstand
greater gravitational force than a human pilot could survive. Cyberattacks that incapacitate
critical port infrastructure or disinformation campaigns and deepfakes
that throw presidential elections. Or even foreign adversaries
taking out satellites, our eyes and ears in space, rendering us blind to global events. All superintelligent weapons of terror. We are at the dawn
of a new age of warfare. I grew up in the birthplace
of a technology that defined the last era of warfare, the atomic bomb. I was keenly aware of how this technology
had fundamentally shaped geopolitics and the nature of war. My parents were both scientists
at Los Alamos National Laboratory. My dad’s a physicist,
and my mom’s an astrophysicist. Their scientific work
in plasma fluid dynamics will have deep implications
for how we understand our universe. So naturally, I knew I wanted to work
on something just as impactful. I decided to become a programmer
and study artificial intelligence. AI is one of the most critical
technologies of our time and with deep implications
for national security and democracy globally. As we saw in World War II
with the atomic bomb, the country that is able
to most rapidly and effectively integrate new technology
into warfighting wins. There's no reason to believe
this will be any different with AI. But in the AI arms race,
we're already behind. From a technological perspective, China is already ahead
of the United States in computer vision AI. And in large language models,
like ChatGPT, they are fast followers. In terms of military implementations, they're outspending us: adjusted for total military budget, China's spending ten times more
than the United States. Why are we so far behind? The answer is twofold. First, data supremacy. Despite having the largest fleet
of military hardware in the world, most of the data from this fleet
is thrown away or inaccessible, hidden away on hard drives
that never see the light of day. This is our Achilles heel. In an AI war, everything
boils down to data. For defense AI, data from the internet is not enough. Most of the data needs to come
from our military assets, sensors and collaborations
with tech companies. Military commanders need to know
how to use data as a military asset. I've heard this first-hand many times, from my conversations
with military personnel, including most recently from Lieutenant General
Richard R. Coffman, deputy commanding general
for United States Army Futures Command. Second, despite being home
to the leading technology companies at the forefront
of artificial intelligence, the US tech industry
has largely shied away from taking on government contracts. Somewhere along the line, tech leaders decided that working
with the government was taboo. As a technologist, I'm often asked
how I'm bettering this world. This is how I'm improving
the future of our world: by helping my country succeed and providing the best tools
and technology to ensure that the United States
government can defend its citizens, allies and partners. (Applause) The Ukraine war has demonstrated
that the nature of war has changed. Through AI overmatch,
Ukraine is challenging an adversary with far superior numbers
of troops and weapons. Before the Ukraine war, Russia had spent an estimated
65 billion US dollars on its military expenditures, whereas Ukraine only spent
about six billion dollars. It's estimated that Russia
had over 900,000 military troops and 1,300 aircraft, whereas Ukraine only had
200,000 military troops and 130 aircraft. Technologies such as drones, AI-based targeting and image intelligence and Javelin missiles have enabled a shocking
defense of Ukraine. AI is proving invaluable for defending
Ukrainian cities and infrastructure against missile and drone bombardment. At Scale, we’re using
our novel machine learning algorithm for battle damage assessment
in key areas affected by the war. We've rapidly analyzed
over 2,000 square kilometers and have identified
over 370,000 structures, including thousands
not previously identified by other open source data sets. We focused on Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro and provided our data directly in a publicly accessible data set
to the broader AI community. One of the key problems we're solving is using AI to analyze massive amounts
of imagery and detect objects because humans just can't keep up. We've received an overwhelming response
from our free AI-ready data set and have provided it directly
to the United States and NATO allies. And it's been downloaded over 2,000 times
by AI companies, researchers, developers and GIS practitioners. AI can also be used for change detection. Simply put, algorithms
can constantly monitor imagery and notify a human to investigate further
if there's a change or a movement. It's clear that AI
is increasingly powering warfare. And based on the rate of progress
in the AI field, I predict that in ten years,
it will be the dominant force. Disinformation and misinformation
are already huge problems. And this technology
is only going to make it worse. Tools like ChatGPT
have enabled AI to generate imagery, text, audio, video, code and even reason. These tools can generate realistic-looking
and realistic-sounding content, which on top of bot-run
social media accounts will make it nearly impossible
to identify disinformation and misinformation online. Bad actors can use these tools
to supercharge misinformation and propagate falsehoods. China already uses
disinformation campaigns and social media manipulations
heavily in Taiwan, particularly during elections. Or take Russia's propaganda machine, which in the wake
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine created a deepfake
of Ukrainian President Zelensky calling for Ukrainian troops to surrender. This deepfake was easy to spot, but the next one may not be. This also takes place within our borders, from social media algorithm manipulation to advertising microtargeting
and geofencing, to deepfakes of politicians
and bot-run social media accounts. The United States is not excused from exacerbating
disinformation and misinformation. These tools are universally accessible
at low or no cost, meaning they can be employed
by anyone anywhere to undermine the sanctity
of democracy globally. However, all hope is not lost. If we properly invest into data infrastructure
and data preparation, all this can be avoided. Deterrence is nothing new
to military thinking. As we saw in World War II
with the atomic bomb, it was a primary factor
in deterring foreign adversaries from going to nuclear war
for more than six decades. Because the stakes of going to war
with such a technology were simply too high. We're likely to see
a new calculus emerge with AI. It's uncharted territory,
nobody knows what it will look like or the toll it will take. How do we know if our AI
is better than our adversaries'? We won't. But one thing is clear: AI can only be as powerful
as the underlying data that is used to fuel its algorithms. Data will be a new kind of ammunition
in the era of AI warfare. In the tech industry,
we often talk about missions. They're often frivolous. Do they really change
the world or save lives? This mission, on the other hand,
really matters. The AI war will define
the future of our world and has the potential
to shift the balance of diplomatic power. It's clear that digital warfare is not some dystopian reality,
tucked away in a faraway future. It is taking place in the here and now. We cannot sit by the sidelines and watch the rise
of an authoritarian regime. It is in moments like this that technologists can either rise
to the challenge or stand idle. I encourage my fellow technologists to understand the austerity
and severity of our times and commit themselves
to supporting national security. While I find it shocking
that most American AI companies have chosen not to support
national security, I do hope others join us. We must fight for the world
we want to live in. It's never mattered more. Thank you. (Applause)"

In this sweet, personal talk, actor Michael Sheen shares how he was also able to take advantage of all the city had to offer, why he's worried that a change in approach to arts education means that kids now don't get the same kind of chances -- and the steps he's taking to ensure that creative up-and-comers get the support and access they deserve.

#TED #TEDTalks #creativity","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'creativity', 'art', 'storytelling', 'theater', 'youth', 'diversity']",2023-08-04T11:22:42-07:00,2023-08-04T11:22:42-07:00,Science & Technology,"I didn't want to miss this opportunity to be able to tell you a couple of stories
that I hope you might enjoy. The first one is about the town
where I come from. It's called Port Talbot in South Wales. It's sort of, I guess,
famous for a couple of things. It's got a steelworks. It's a sort of mainly working-class town
built up around the steelworks, big council estate
to house the workers there that my grandparents grew up on and my parents grew up on as well. And it's also, I suppose,
known for, weirdly, actors. And I said that this story
was going to be about the town. It's actually about a couple of people
who come from the town. So this first story was told to me,
it's from the horse's mouth. So one of the legendary sons
of Port Talbot is of course, the great
actor Richard Burton. And the story goes
that Richard Burton, at the height of his fame, came back to Port Talbot and was staying at his elder
sister's house, Cissy, who actually raised him in Port Talbot. And they were there,
in Cissy's house in Port Talbot, and there was a knock on the door and Cissy went to open the door. And it was a young, young lad. And he said, this young lad said,
""Is, is Richard Burton there?"" And Cissy was like, ""Richie, come, there's
a lad here to see you."" So Richard Burton comes down and this young lad's
standing there looking at him, ""It's the great Richard Burton."" And Cissy says, ""This young lad
wants an autograph."" And Burton said, ""Do you speak Welsh?"" The lad was like, ""No."" ""Well, not a proper Welshman then."" And Cissy says, ""This little lad is the son
of the bakers round the corner, down from where the Regent Cinema is."" And Burton said to this little lad, ""I used to work at the co-op
just up the road from the cinema. I was hopeless."" And this little lad couldn't believe
that he got his autograph. And this little lad grew up
into a man who told me that not only was this
an extraordinary moment for him, because it was Richard Burton
who was doing on the biggest stage what he hoped that he would do
when he grew up, but also because this
little lad felt like -- he was always told he was a bit stupid, a bit “twp,” as we’d say in Wales. And Richard Burton,
the great Richard Burton, saying that he was always
a bit hopeless as well, gave him such hope. Now, that little lad grew up
to be Anthony Hopkins. And Anthony Hopkins told me that story and I, me, myself,
growing up in Port Talbot, it was knowing out there
had been Richard Burton and out there now was Anthony Hopkins, two people who came
from the same town as me, who sounded like me a bit, who looked a bit like me,
but were out there. If it was possible for them, then maybe it would be possible for me. Now, that is an incredibly
important thing. To see your background, your experience, your history
represented out there in the world, having a voice, speaking on a platform, doing the things that perhaps you hope
that you would be able to do. If you can't see yourself out there or anyone who looks like you
or sounds like you, it's very hard to imagine
that you'll be able to do that as well. And that’s one part of what
was incredibly important, I've realized over the years, of what was incredibly important
about me being able to have the life and the opportunities and the career that I've had. But it's only one part. I've realized more and more
as time has gone on how much I owe everything, all the opportunities
I've had, to other people and the work of other people. I come from an incredibly
supportive family. All my family were into
performing in some way, amateur performing in some way, so I knew from a very early age
that it was something that you could do and that you got, sort of,
brownie points for. So that was important. And as time went on, my family were always there to take me
to school rehearsals in the evening, youth theater, whatever it might be. They'd come and see me
in any performance I was doing, and that meant a lot. It's meant a lot more to me
as time has gone on, because, of course, I took
everything for granted, didn't I, at the time. But having that supportive family
was incredibly important. And coming from a community, a working-class community,
like Port Talbot, a steel town, it's not somewhere that you would expect
to be that supportive of people going into the poncy arts, you know. But Richard Burton had done it,
Anthony Hopkins had done it, and there was a kind of nobility to it. There was certainly a respectability to it
and a respect for what they had done. And so that made a big difference. But in some ways, I think
the most important part was that I was able to do performances
in school, drama in school, and then I auditioned
for a youth theater, local youth theater. It was the county youth theater. And again, at the time
I took it all for granted. But now I look back and I can see
that there was an incredibly ... powerful youth arts infrastructure
that had grown up in the area. Not by chance. It hadn't happened randomly. It was because one man,
man called Godfrey Evans, who was a teacher at
the Comprehensive School on the Sandfields estate, that was the estate that housed
the steelworkers families, he had created an incredibly
kind of, progressive, liberal theater program
in that comprehensive school and eventually that spread
to the entire county. And he became 
the chief adviser of county ... of drama and dance in the county and created the youth theater
that I was a product of, that Russell T. Davies
was a product of, many, many people. The youth dance company that
Catherine Zeta-Jones was a product of, the orchestra, the brass band. It was an incredible diverse array of art, all funded through the education system. And I was absolutely a product of that. And I joined the youth theater. And at a certain point, everyone in our youth theater
just auditioned for drama schools, got in, went off to drama
schools in London, went into the profession. I never questioned it. I didn't think that was strange
or odd in any way. It was just like, that's what happened. And so that's what I did. And I got a grant to be able
to go to RADA in London and came to RADA and then left RADA, went straight into the West End doing a play with Vanessa Redgrave, never looked back. As time has gone on, I've seen that pathway,
let's call it, disappear. So I know that if I was around now, starting off, that pathway
wouldn't be there. And I had tremendous advantages, I realize now, with family, community,
all kinds of things. And it does make me worry
that not only has my pathway disappeared, my school stopped doing drama,
school closed down eventually, the youth theater lost its funding. Grants weren't available anymore
for people to go to drama school. So I've seen my footsteps
kind of disappear. And if someone like myself,
with all the advantages I had, wouldn't be able to do it, what about the kids who are out there
who don’t have those advantages, who don't have maybe a family who can take them
to youth theater rehearsals or you know, whatever it might be. Don't have a school that pushed them, don’t have that kind of
infrastructure there to create that pathway for them, what happens to them? And then that leads
to a bigger question, I suppose, of, if young people, coming from certain kinds
of working-class backgrounds, aren't able to come through into the arts, I mean, I was an actor, but it could be anything
within the arts or creative industries or journalism, writing. The conversation
that we have as a country, as a nation, as a community, what is that conversation like
if we're only hearing from the people who are able to afford to get through to the point where they get to speak,
get to have a voice? It makes that conversation
incredibly one-sided. I mean, there are figures
that I can quote you that I'll just keep to a few. But the Office of National Statistics
reported a few years back that of all writers in Britain, 47 percent came from the most
privileged social starting points, compared to 10 percent
coming from working-class backgrounds. The Sutton Trust report in 2019
said that of newspaper columnists -- so these are people
who've really got a big part to play in setting what our
national conversation is, newspaper columnist across
the political spectrum -- 44 percent of those
newspaper columnists come from independent schools, whereas only seven percent
of the population generally go to independent schools. So there’s a massive
overrepresentation there. And of those newspaper columnists, 33 percent, one in three,
are part of that independent school, Oxbridge, pathway pipeline. And those are the people
who are, you know, have an enormous part to play in setting
what our conversation is. You know, who gets to speak, who gets to tell their story and how does it get told. And if that pathway is there for people coming through independent
schools and through Oxbridge, and that's not just
into acting or writing, that's across the top jobs
across our whole nation, where are those other pathways for people who are not coming
from those sorts of backgrounds? It's so important that we start early
to create those pathways. In some ways, I feel like it's too late
by the time you're 18, 19 out in the world. How do you get people, young people, young kids, to feel like there's something
out there for them, that they see themselves represented
and know that it's possible, as Anthony Hopkins did
with Richard Burton, as I did with them? And how do you then create
the pathway from that moment? And let's say that that moment happens where you see the possibility
for you doing something. Where is that yellow brick road
that goes from there all the way to actually getting
into the industry that you want to be in? If that pathway doesn't exist, because it certainly exists
for some people, but it doesn't exist for you because of some accident
of birth and geography, what happens then? There will always be individuals who are able to break through in some way or get support and become
the exception to the rule. But how do we change
structurally our system so that it's not just
about individuals breaking through, that everyone gets the same opportunity? So I found myself sitting
at my kitchen table during the first lockdown,
talking to Professor Katy Shaw about a project that she
had been involved with, that I was incredibly inspired by,
the Common People project. I suddenly had a grandiose vision of supporting people
coming from working-class backgrounds, underrepresented backgrounds, in storytelling. And we started to hammer out
an idea for a project that could go out into communities and towns and look for those people. We started to think about a project where people were given the opportunity, asked to get involved and that were then supported through it and would get mentors. So people who've already made
a mark in the industry and the areas that they wanted to, helping them, supporting them, advising them, giving them
a bit of confidence and then to create a platform
for what came out of it to be shared nationally and to try and influence industry. And, whether it's publishers or, you know, broadcasters or whoever it might be,
to open their doors. And first of all, to acknowledge
the difficulties and the obstacles and then encourage people to come in. To renew us, to hear voices that we've not
heard from historically. And to hear of those experiences
and those stories told by themselves rather than having their story
told at them or to them. That people are able
to actually tell their own stories. And we believed that that would be
an incredibly powerful thing, not only for the individuals
involved, but for all of us. And so A Writing Chance was born
through that conversation, really. We have 11 people eventually
who got through to be our first cohort who would go through the program
and get mentoring and get the financial support
and everything else. And I remember reading
Stephen Tuffin's piece that he submitted, which was about ... caring for his mother in her final days. And I remember thinking, not only is this one
of the most moving things I've read in these submissions, this is one of the most
moving things I've ever read. It was an extraordinary,
searing, incredibly raw, beautiful piece of writing. And in that moment, I knew that this was going
to exceed all expectations. And it did. The 11 writers that we finally
worked with for the last year, reading what they've done
has been absolutely revelatory. Whether it's reading about the experience of marginalized bodies by Grace Quantock. Lifting the veil on what it is like
to live with a disability and how people relate to that. It's extraordinary. Everything she's written
has been extraordinary. Stephen's piece, about caring
for his mother in her final days ... I will never forget that piece. It will stay with me
for the rest of my life. There's David Clancy,
hairdresser in Ulverston, talking about how he turned
having gibes thrown at him for being gay when he was younger, being kicked out
of his own house by his parents for being gay and then having to move
back into the house with his mum, or choosing to move back into the house
with his mother and father, as the pandemic struck,
in order to look after them. That experience. Whether it's Maya Jordan, coming to write her novel
about the goddess of the River Severn. These are incredible pieces of writing from and with voices and experiences
that I just never heard before. It's absolutely revelatory to me. To see their writing in a magazine, on a national newspaper, being performed live on stage, being broadcast
on BBC Sounds in a podcast. This is extraordinary stuff. I remember Maya Jordan telling me that -- the idea of being
a writer on her estate, she said, ""There were no
writers on our estate. To say to someone
that you wanted to be a writer was like saying you wanted
to be an astronaut."" It was amazing to be able to go up to Maya after the live performance
that we did in Cardiff. And to say to us all, ""How does it feel to be an astronaut?"" (Music)"

and I do voice impressions. For example, this is Kristen Wiig
about to go skydiving. “I changed my mind. I'm, I'm scared, I'm scared
I'll get stuck on a cloud, and then I’ll have to 
become an angel.” (Laughter and applause) Thanks. This is Sandra Bullock if she were to knock over
a bunch of dominoes. Just pretend they're here in the room. “No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.” That's it. (Laughter) She always does that in movies. And this is Lady Gaga if she gave birth to a baby
in ""A Star is Born."" (Vocalizing) (Vocalizing baby crying) (Applause and laughter) Miss Gaga, a star is born. (Laughter) And this is Melissa Villaseñor
giving a TED Talk. Hi, I'm Melissa Villaseñor
and I do voice impressions. (Laughter) A little bit about me. Born and raised
in Los Angeles, California, to a Mexican-American family. Middle child, OK, I was very shy. I didn't do the best in school, but I was very observant,
maybe a little creepy. And I realized I had this superpower
of doing voice impressions when I was 12 years old. And it all began with the pop
singers at that time, OK. Britney Spears: “All you people look at me
like I’m a little girl.” I know, spooky. (Laughter) And hot. I should do that all the time, huh? (Laughter) I sang a lot of Shakira back then, just, “There’s a she wolf in the closet.” And I was kind of wolf-like singing at 13,
you know, hairy, puberty days. (Laughter) I looked up to Gwen Stefani
in high school. I loved Gwen Stefani from No Doubt,
and I wanted to look like her. So I shaved my eyebrows
real thin to copy her, like in the ""Return of Saturn""
days, that Gwen. And I thought, ""Oh, my friends
at school must think I look just like Gwen Stefani."" I probably looked more like It, the clown. It was spooky, thin, just, “I kinda always knew
I’d end up looking like It.” (Laughter) I loved making my friends laugh
at school with my voices. And I suddenly wasn't so shy anymore. I felt like, oh, this is why I'm here. This is my purpose,
to bring joy and laughs. And I suddenly got obsessed
with Saturday Night Live at 15 years old. And I was so determined, I was like, I'm going to become a comedian and I'm going to get on the cast
of Saturday Night Live. So right after high school, I graduate, I go straight to signing up
for open mic shows in Hollywood. My parents went straight
to worrying for their daughter. (Laughter) Now I went to junior college for them. You know, I went for, like,
a quarter or a semester. I don't know, I wasn't there
long enough to find out. (Laughter) But thankfully I got amazing opportunities
pretty early on in my career because I think it was rare to see
a female voice impressionist at comedy clubs. And a cute one. (Laughs) (Laughter) But I got the opportunity
to be on “America’s Got Talent” season six in 2011. I'm not going to lie,
I killed it, OK, 90 seconds. I did a bunch of impressions, just, Barbara Walters. I did a Natalie Portman
from the ""Black Swan."" I did a Sarah Silverman. Wanda Sykes. I did Miley Cyrus. And Christina Aguilera, oh, oh. (Laughter) From that exposure, being on that show, I was able to quit my part-time job and become a headlining comedian
around the country for clubs and colleges. Now, that's amazing if you've been
doing stand up for a while, but I only had ten minutes
and suddenly I had to do an hour at comedy club. So I bombed a lot. I cried in a lot of hotels
around the country. But I noticed something
as I was on the road, working on jokes and performing, I noticed that everyone was laughing
at all the impression bits. But every time I tried to talk
about myself and my life, my family, it didn't get laughs
and it was starting to bug me. People will come up to me
after shows and they would go, ""Oh, I love your Owen Wilson impression. He's so funny."" And I'd say, ""Thanks,"" but inside I'd be like, ""Wait, do they only like me
for my Owen Wilson impression, wow? That really bums me out, man."" (Laughter) So at that point I became
determined again. I was like, no, I'm going
to write about myself. I want to find my own voice
among the voices that I do because I think it's important
and it's special, and I think it's the best
feeling to connect as your true self with other people. (Laughs) (Applause) And, you know, thankfully,
I did find a voice. Yeah, a funny-sounding one, 
but a voice. And I like making fun of things in life. It just makes life
a little easier to handle. I like making fun of my energy. It's not sexy. You feel it. (Laughter) My energy is a lot like a proud dad's. (Laughter) No wonder relationships don't work out. Because every time I go on a date, I check out the dude, first thing I go, ""Man, look at you."" (Laughter) ""Ah, you look good. Is that a new jacket? You look really sharp, my boy."" (Laughter) ""Here's 20 bucks. Don't tell your mom, go ahead."" (Laughter) I like talking about how
I'm Mexican, you know? And I don't look it,
a lot of people don't believe me. All my life, people would say, ""Oh, you're Mexican?
You don't look Mexican."" And I get so apologetic, I'm like, ""Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot my sombrero. Oh, man. Did I not roll my Rs enough? Sorry."" And I just have to salsa away. (Laughter) I know, exterior, you wouldn't believe it, but just know that inside ... A lot of piñatas in here. (Laughter) I bleed Tapatío. (Laughter) You know, I don't speak Spanish. I was a lazy kid, second generation Mexican,
I didn't work on it. I know, shame on me. Or as you would say in Spanish ... I don't know. (Laughter) I have been working on my Spanish though, because there's a lot of relatives of mine
that only speak in Spanish. And I think back when I would hang out
with my great grandma, my abuelita, you know, I would just nod
and smile and wave at her. How rude. But she didn't mind, she would just stare
at me lovingly, you know. I'd be like, ""Hey, abuelita, how are you?"" “Ay.” (Speaking in Spanish) Thanks, you’re bonita, too. (Laughter) ""Ay."" And then she'd start talking
crap about me in Spanish. (Speaking in Spanish) (Laughs) (Speaking in Spanish) (Laughter) (Laughs) I know I’m loca. You too, huh? ""No, me no."" (Laughter) (Speaking in Spanish) (Speaking in Spanish) What? The tone changed. What are you two saying over here? I don’t like this. Why are you sad now? (Speaking in Spanish) What is that, boyfriend? I don’t want one right now, I’m free. (Speaking in Spanish) (Laughter) Fair enough. See, I like imitating my family
and talking about them, because that'll never get old,
that's always a part of me. Celebrities, I don't even
know them, you know? But this means so much to me. I like imitating my mom,
she's a funny character. When I'm driving my car
and she's in the passenger seat, she's a backseat driver, she comments on my driving, and she knows it pisses me off. So she whispers everything
about my driving, which is like, that's worse. Everything sounds so dirty
to my innocent ears. I'm driving, she's in the passenger seat
holding on to that rail, you know. She's pressing -- I didn't know there was
a brake pedal on that side because she is pressing it, she's just -- (Breathes sharply through teeth) (Whispering) ""Slow down."" (Laughter) (Whispering) ""Oh, you're going too fast."" (Laughter) (Whispering) ""Oh, we're not in a rush."" (Laughter) (Whispering) ""Oh, my back."" (Laughter) ""Oh, there's a spot right there, right there, right there,
right there, oh."" (Laughter) ""You missed it."" Ew, nasty. (Laughter) Now, after nine years in my journey, I did get the chance to audition
for Saturday Night Live in 2016, and I get cast on the show. (Cheers and applause) It was so beautiful
to be on the show and magical, I felt like I entered ... I mean, my dream, it was real. It was ... It was beautiful. And being on SNL amplified
everything I ever wanted, especially for doing voices. Now, I left SNL after six seasons
on the show, just recently, because, one, I wasn't strong enough anymore
to handle the pressure of the show. Two, I wasn't having fun anymore
looking up celebrities. And three, there was something inside me,
inside Meliss, that was saying, there's more to discover about myself,
there's more talents, there's more things
to learn, to expand on. So now I'm in a funny position
because I did the -- Evil laugh. (Imitates evil laugh) (Laughter) No, but it is a funny position I'm in because that was the goal
I worked for since 15 and it's so like, now, like, what do I do? Has anyone here reached a life goal
and still have years left? (Laughter and applause) There was one day recently, I Googled ""What the hell do Olympians do
after they go to the Olympics?"" Just because I want to know
other people that feel this way. I did find out on Google,
Olympians become teachers and mentors. And I thought, ""Well, eff that. I don't want to do that."" (Laughter) The thing I noticed
within the six years of being on SNL, there was something -- 
the best stuff that I did were pieces where I was doing
my impressions, but I was also very much being Melissa. So as I go forth in my journey, I've got to remember to always share
the gifts that I have of doing voices and also make sure I could be
vulnerable and be myself. So something I love to share
at my standup shows is how I struggle with low self-esteem, and I constantly have to tell myself
positive talk and affirmations. Now I don't use my voice. No, I sound too sarcastic,
I don't believe me. (Laughter) If I say, ""I'm good
at what I do, I'm funny."" I don't ... no. Thankfully, I have
a Dolly Parton impression, so I say my affirmations as Dolly. Works way better. “I’m good at what I do. I work hard.” (Laughter) (Singing) I work nine to five. What a way to make a living. More like 10 minutes
because I’m doing a TED Talk. (Cheers and applause) So I hope the lesson
or thing you leave with is that I hope you could put
your masks down, your personas, and be your true, true self
because man, it rocks. Maybe learn a Dolly impression
so you could look in the mirrorm and say, ""I am brave, I am beautiful."" Or better yet, learn
your Melissa impression so you can look in the mirror and say, ""Man, look at you. Yeah, you're cool."" Muchas gracias, thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #nature","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'science', 'technology', 'animals', 'nature', 'communication', 'sound', 'conservation', 'language', 'AI']",2023-07-18T04:00:10-07:00,2023-07-18T04:00:10-07:00,Science & Technology,"So we're in the middle of a fierce debate about how artificial intelligence
will change human society. But have you thought
about how AI will transform your relationship to the non-human world? So these are bioacoustic recorders. And I've spent years studying
how scientists use devices like this, combined with AI, to listen to the hidden sounds of nature and decode non-human communication. Hidden sounds, because much acoustic
communication in nature occurs in the high ultrasound,
above your hearing range, or in the deep infrasound,
below your hearing range. So I'm going to play a sound. I want you to listen and try
to guess who or what this is. (Chirping sound) So that was a bat. That was bat ultrasound,
recorded above your hearing range, but slowed down so you could hear. So that was an advertisement call
from the peak of the mating season. Scientists can decode these calls, so a sample bat to English translation
would be, and I quote, ""Pay attention. I'm a Pipistrellus nathusii bat,
specifically male. My name is X. I am landing here and we share a common social identity
and common communication pool."" For a pickup line by a bat, not bad. (Laughter) So scientists have recorded millions
of bat vocalizations like this and they've decoded many of them using AI. And they've revealed
that bats have dialects that they pass down
from one generation to the next, and that baby bats
learn to speak just like you did, by listening to the adults around them and babbling back
until they speak adult bat. So bats have far more complex
communication than we knew, and they're only one of many examples. Listen to this. (Melodic chirping sounds) So those are orcas who live right
here in the Salish Sea. Scientists can decode individual
orca calls using AI and they've revealed that orcas
also pass down their dialects from one generation to the next. So it turns out that orcas and bats are not the only
creatures that make ultrasound. Moths, mice, beetles, rats. Even some of our smaller primate
cousins like this tarsier. At the other end, in the deep infrasound, elephants and whales, tigers and some birds make sound. So when we first learned about these
secret sounds of the world, we're often surprised
because humans tend to believe that what we cannot perceive
does not exist. And so we miss a lot. One of my favorite examples
is this peacock. So to you, this looks
like a visual mating display. And it is. But this peacock is also making
very loud infrasound with its tail, which you cannot hear,
but female peahens can. And it is an important factor
in their mating decisions. So this peacock is giving a rock concert. (Laughter) Now, we have lived
with peacocks for millennia, but we only just figured this out. Scientists also used to think
that turtles were voiceless and mother turtles abandoned their nests
after laying their eggs. But we've just discovered
that baby Amazonian turtles communicate through their shells
before they hatch to coordinate the moment of their birth and then follow their mother's calls
to safety in the water. Even creatures without ears
are exquisitely sensitive to sound. So this is a coral larva. When coral larvae are born,
usually at a mass spawning event a few days after the full moon,
they wash out to sea. So scientists used to think
that these little larvae, these tiny dots that you see here, were helpless, randomly pushed around
by wind and waves and currents. But it turns out that coral larvae
are acoustically attuned. They can hear the sounds of healthy reefs. They can hear the sound
of their home reef, their mother reef, and they swim back home
across miles of open ocean. So these are tiny creatures
with no central nervous system. But we think they do that with these hairs that you see on the outside
of their bodies. They're a lot like the hairs
inside your ears that are enabling you
to listen to me right now, so you can think of a coral larva
a little bit like an inside-out ear, except that its sense of hearing
is profoundly more sensitive than your own because they hear
with their entire bodies. Even our planet makes sound. Volcanoes, earthquakes sound so low
and strong and powerful, they travel very far, passing through soil and stone
and even solid walls. Listen to this hydrothermal vent
deep under the ocean. (Deep, rhythmic hum) So in nature, sound is everywhere
and silence is an illusion. So scientists are also listening
to the vast extent of interspecies communication. So this bat is using ultrasound
to hunt this moth. Its echolocation beam
is locked onto its prey, but the moth is also emitting ultrasound. It's jamming the bat sonar
in an attempt to escape. This plant is also emitting ultrasound,
which varies depending on its condition. Scientists have trained an algorithm
to listen to this plant. Simply by listening it can detect with about 70
percent accuracy whether the plant is healthy,
dehydrated or injured. So this is peer-reviewed
research, by the way. So we cannot hear these sounds,
but we think many insects can. Does this mean that humans
could use digital tech to one day communicate
with other species? Well, some scientists think so and they're using machine learning to try
to decode the acoustics of other species. So there are teams of computer scientists
and linguists and biologists working on decoding
sperm whale bioacoustics. They're also building entire dictionaries. So there's an elephant dictionary
with thousands of sounds. Elephants, for example,
have a specific signal for honeybee. So I'd love to share just one
of these sounds with you. It was recorded at a moment
of great joy and celebration, the birth of a new baby. (Elephant roaring) (Applause) So the further we listen
across the tree of life, the more complex interspecies
communication would be. Listen to this honeybee. (Honeybee buzzing) Now listen to this honeybee queen. (Queen bee tooting) So you thought you knew
what honeybees sounded like. OK. Honeybee communication
is incredibly complex. It's acoustic, positional,
spatial, vibrational. The queen has her own signals. So scientists are encoding
these signals into robots. This robot is attempting,
but not succeeding, to communicate with the hive. The bees mostly ignore or attack it. But one day, we hope, the inventors hope, that this robot
will communicate well enough to allow scientists to monitor
the health of the hive. Now, would that be a good thing? Some believe that interspecies
communication would help foster respect and empathy for nature, others believe that it is profoundly
disrespectful and unethical to eavesdrop and engage in this way. And there could be a really big downside. Listen to this robin. (Bird chirping) So that was not actually a robin. That was a deepfake created by an artist,
Daisy Ginsberg, using AI. Clever, beautiful. But think of the potential for misuse
by hunters or poachers. Interspecies communication
needs strong ethical guardrails. And anyway, maybe it's a bit
self-centered to think other species would even want
to communicate with us. (Laughter) So what if we were to use bioacoustics for something of immediate
practical value, like doing something
about our massive biodiversity crisis? Let's go back to the coral reefs. Listen to this healthy reef sound. (Chirping, croaking and sizzling sounds) Pretty lively, right? But coral reefs are disappearing. If you were to go
to most coral reefs today, you'd hear something like this. (Staticky sound) It's like a ghost town of the sea. When we lose species, we lose voices. When we lose landscapes,
we also lose soundscapes. There is a ray of hope. The healthy reef sounds
that you just heard can be used to regenerate coral reefs. Scientists are doing this. It's a bit like music therapy for nature. So this is not going to solve
all the problems coral reefs face, notably climate change. But if we can address the massive
epidemic of noise pollution that is harming
and killing marine creatures, we could use bioacoustics
to restore some biodiversity. Bioacoustics could also help
protect animals on the move. So this baby whale was killed by a ship. Tragically, this is a common cause
of death of North Atlantic right whales, one of the most endangered
species in the world. So to address this, scientists are now launching
a new bioacoustics program off the east coast of North America to triangulate the locations of whales and convey the information
to ships’ captains in real time. The ships then have to slow down,
stop, move out of the way. Not a single right whale has died
of a ship strike in this zone since this program was launched. (Applause) So this may be the thing
that saves this species. So think about it. A few decades ago, we were harpooning
these whales nearly to extinction. Today, we've invented a technology that allows a community
of less than 400 whales, simply by singing, to guide the movements
of tens of thousands of ships in a watershed that's home
to tens of millions of people. One day, these whale lanes
may be everywhere in the oceans. For the orcas who live here
in the Salish Sea, this would be just in time
because there are only a few dozen left. A final thought. About 400 years ago, the inventors of the microscope
were astonished to discover the microbial world. They had no idea their invention
would lead to the discovery of DNA and the ability to manipulate
the code of life. Around the same time, the inventors of the telescope
were gazing up at the stars, not knowing their invention would allow
humanity to look back in time to the origins of the universe. Optics decenters humanity
within the solar system, within the cosmos. Bioacoustics decenters humanity
within the tree of life. Our commonality is greater than we knew. Now today we're using bioacoustics
to protect species and decode their communication, but tomorrow, I believe,
we'll be using bioacoustics combined with machine intelligence to explore the frontiers
of biological intelligence. Many biological intelligences
are very different than our own, but they're no less worthy of exploration. And maybe one day in a speculative future, instead of a human here on stage, maybe bioacoustics would enable
an orca to give a TED talk. (Laughter) Why not? Sharing orca stories about dodging ships and seismic blasts and human hunters, stories about desperately seeking
the last remaining salmon, stories about trying to survive
on this beautiful planet in this crazy moment in our era of untethered human creativity and unprecedented environmental emergency. Now those would be ideas worth spreading. (Chirping sounds) (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #ai","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'science', 'technology', 'computers', 'AI', 'math', 'TEDx', 'machine learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'stephen Wolfram', 'ruliad']",2023-10-31T04:00:36-07:00,2023-10-31T04:00:36-07:00,Science & Technology,"Human language, mathematics, logic. These are all ways to formalize the world. And in our century, there's a new and yet
more powerful one: computation. For nearly 50 years, I've had the great privilege of building up an ever-taller tower
of science and technology that's based on that idea of computation. And so today, I want to tell you
a little bit about what that's led to. There's a lot to talk about,
so I'm going to go quickly. And sometimes I'm going
to summarize in a sentence what I've written a whole book about. But you know, I last gave a TED talk 13 years ago, in February 2010, soon after WolframAlpha launched, and I ended that talk with a question. Question was, is computation ultimately
what's underneath everything in our universe? I gave myself a decade to find out. And actually, it could
have needed a century. But in April 2020,
just after the decade mark, we were thrilled to be able to announce what seems to be the ultimate
machine code of the universe. And yes, it's computational. So computation isn't just
a possible formalization, it's the ultimate one for our universe. It all starts from the idea that space,
like matter, is made of discrete elements, and from that structure of space
and everything in it, it's defined just
by a network of relations between these elements
that we might call atoms of space. So it's all very elegant,
but deeply abstract. But here's kind of
a humanized representation, a version of the very beginning
of the universe. And what we're seeing here
is the emergence of space and everything in it by the successive application
of very simple computational rules. And remember, these dots
are not atoms in any existing space. They're atoms of space
that get put together to make space. And yes, if we kept going long enough, we could build
our whole universe this way. So eons later, here's a chunk of space
with two little black holes that, if we wait a little while,
will eventually merge, generating little ripples
of gravitational radiation. And remember, all of this is built
from pure computation. But like fluid mechanics
emerging from molecules, what emerges here is space-time
and Einstein's equations for gravity, though there are deviations
that we just might be able to detect, like that the dimensionality of space
won't always be precisely three. And there's something else. Our computational rules can inevitably
be applied in many ways, each defining a different
kind of thread of time, a different path of history
that can branch and merge. But as observers
embedded in this universe, we're branching and merging, too. And it turns out that quantum mechanics
emerges as the story of how branching minds
perceive a branching universe. So the little pink lines
you might be able to see here show the structure
of what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches. And one of the stunningly
beautiful things, at least for physicists like me, is that the same phenomenon
that in physical space gives us gravity, in branchial space gives us
quantum mechanics. So in the history of science so far, I think we can identify
sort of four broad paradigms for making models of the world
that can be distinguished kind of by how they deal with time. So in antiquity and in plenty
of areas of science, even today, it's all about kind of,
what are things made of. And time doesn't really enter. But in the 1600s came the idea
of modeling things with mathematical formulas
in which time enters, but basically just as a coordinate value. Then in the 1980s, and this is something
in which I was deeply involved, came the idea of making models by starting with simple
computational rules and just letting them run. So can one predict what will happen? No. There's what I call
computational irreducibility, in which, in effect, the passage of time
corresponds to an irreducible computation that we have to run in order to work out
how it will turn out. But now there's kind of something, something even more --
in our physics project, there’s things that have become
multi-computational, with many threads of time that can only be knitted
together by an observer. So it's kind of a new paradigm
that actually seems to unlock things not only in fundamental physics, but also in the foundations of mathematics
and computer science, and possibly in areas like biology
and economics as well. So I talked about building up the universe by repeatedly applying
a computational rule. But how is that rule picked? Well, actually it isn't, because all possible rules are used, and we're building up
what I call the ruliad, the kind of deeply abstract
but unique object that is the entangled limit
of all possible computational processes. Here's a tiny fragment of it
shown in terms of Turing machines. So this ruliad is everything. And we as observers
are necessarily part of it. In the ruliad as a whole, in a sense, everything
computationally possible can happen. But observers like us just sample
specific slices of the ruliad. And there are two crucial facts about us. First, we're computationally bounded,
our minds are limited, and second, we believe
we're persistent in time, even though we're made of different
atoms of space at every moment. So then, here's the big result. What observers with those characteristics
perceive in the ruliad necessarily follows certain laws. And those laws turn out to be precisely the three key theories
of 20th century physics: general relativity, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics
in the second law. So it's because we're observers like us that we perceive
the laws of physics we do. We can think of sort of different minds as being at different places
in rulial space. Human minds who think alike are nearby, animals further away, and further out, we get
to kind of alien minds where it's hard to make a translation. So how can we get intuition
for all of this? Well, one thing we can do
is use generative AI to take what amounts to an incredibly
tiny slice of the ruliad aligned with images
we humans have produced. We can think of this
as sort of a place in the ruliad described by using the concept
of a cat in a party hat. So zooming out,
we saw there what we might call Cat Island. Pretty soon we’re in a kind of
an inter-concept space. Occasionally things will look familiar, but mostly, what we'll see is things
we humans don't have words for. In physical space, we explore the universe by sending out spacecraft. In rulial space, we explore more by expanding our concepts
and our paradigms. We can kind of get a sense
of what's out there by sampling possible rules, doing what I call ruliology. So even with incredibly simple rules, there's incredible richness. But the issue is that most of it
doesn't yet connect with things we humans
understand or care about. It's like when we look
at the natural world and only gradually realize that we can
use features of it for technology. So even after everything
our civilization has achieved, we're just at the very, very beginning
of exploring rulial space. What about AIs? Well, just like we can do ruliology, AIs can in principle go out
and explore rulial space. Left to their own devices, though, they'll mostly just be doing things we humans don't connect with
or care about. So the big achievements
of AI in recent times have been about making systems
that are closely aligned with us humans. We train LLMs on billions of web pages
so they can produce texts that's typical of what we humans write. And yes, the fact that this works is undoubtedly telling us
some deep scientific things about the semantic grammar of language and generalizations of things like logic that perhaps we should
have known centuries ago. You know, for much of human history, we were kind of like the LLMs, figuring things out by kind of matching
patterns in our minds. But then came more systematic
formalization and eventually computation. And with that, we got a whole other level
of power to truly create new things and to, in effect, go wherever
we want in the ruliad. But the challenge is to do that in a way
that connects with what we humans, and our AIs, understand. In fact, I've devoted
a large part of my life to kind of trying to build that bridge. It's all been about creating a language
for expressing ourselves computationally, a language for computational thinking. The goal is to formalize what we know
about the world in computational terms, to have computational ways to represent
cities and chemicals and movies and humor and formulas
and our knowledge about them. It’s been a vast undertaking that spanned
more than four decades of my life, but it's something
very unique and different. But I'm happy to report
that in what has been Mathematica and is now the Wolfram Language, I think we firmly succeeded in creating a truly full-scale computational language. In effect, every one of these functions here
can be thought of as formalizing and encapsulating, in computational terms, some facet of the intellectual
achievements of our civilization. It's sort of the most concentrated form
of intellectual expression that I know, sort of finding the essence of everything
and coherently expressing it in the design of our
computational language. For me personally, it's been an amazing journey,
kind of, year after year, building the sort of tower of ideas
and technology that's needed. And nowadays sharing
that process with the world in things like open
live streams and so on. A few centuries ago, the development of mathematical notation, and what amounts
to the language of mathematics, gave a systematic way to express math
and made possible algebra and calculus, and eventually all of modern
mathematical science. And computational language now
provides a similar path, letting us ultimately create
a computational X for all imaginable fields X. I mean, we've seen the growth
of computer science, CS, but computational language opens up
something ultimately much bigger and broader, CX. I mean, for 70 years
we've had programming languages which are about telling computers
in their terms what to do. But computational language is about something
intellectually much bigger. It's about taking everything
we can think about and operationalizing it
in computational terms. You know, I built the Wolfram Language first and foremost
because I wanted to use it myself. And now when I use it, I feel like it's kind of giving me
some kind of superpower. I just have to imagine something
in computational terms. And then the language sort of almost
magically lets me bring it into reality, see its consequences, and build on them. And yes, that's the sort of superpower that's let me do things
like our physics project. And over the past 35 years, it's been my great privilege to share
this superpower with many other people, and by doing so, to have enabled an incredible number
of advances across many fields. It's sort of a wonderful thing to see
people, researchers, CEOs, kids, using our language to fluently
think in computational terms, kind of crispening up their own thinking, and then in effect, automatically
calling in computational superpowers. And now it's not just people
who can do that. AIs can use our computational
language as a tool, too. Yes, to get their facts straight, but even more importantly,
to compute new facts. There are already some integrations
of our technology into LLMs. There's a lot more you'll be seeing soon. And, you know, when it comes
to building new things in a very powerful emerging workflow, it's basically to start by telling
the LLM roughly what you want, then to have it try to express that
in precise Wolfram Language, then, and this is a critical feature
of our computational language, compared to, for example,
programming language, you as a human can read the code, and if it does what you want, you can use it as kind of
a dependable component to build on. OK, but let's say we use more and more AI, more and more computation. What's the world going to be like? From the industrial revolution on, we’ve been used to doing engineering
where we can in effect, see how the gears mesh
to understand how things work. But computational irreducibility now shows us that that won't
always be possible. We won't always be able to make
a kind of simple human or, say, mathematical narrative to explain or predict
what a system will do. And yes, this is science, in effect,
eating itself from the inside. From all the successes
of mathematical science, we've come to believe that somehow,
if we only could find them, there'd be formulas
to kind of predict everything. But now computational irreducibility
shows us that that isn't true. And that in effect, to find out
what a system will do, we have to go through the same
irreducible computational steps as the system itself. Yes, it's a weakness of science, but it's also why the passage of time
is significant and meaningful and why we can't just sort of
jump ahead to get the answer. We have to live the steps. It's actually going to be, I think,
a great societal dilemma of the future. If we let our AIs achieve their
kind of full computational potential, they'll have lots
of computational irreducibility and we won't be able
to predict what they'll do. But if we put constraints on them
to make them more predictable, we'll limit what they can do for us. So what will it feel like if our world
is full of computational irreducibility? Well, it's really nothing new because that's the story
with much of nature. And what's happened there is that we've found ways
to operate within nature, even though nature
can sometimes still surprise us. And so it will be with the AIs. We might give them a constitution,
but there will always be consequences we can't predict. Of course, even figuring out societally
what we want from the AIs is hard. Maybe we need you know, a promptocracy where people write prompts
instead of just voting. But basically, every control
the outcome scheme seems full of both political philosophy and computational irreducibility gotchas. You know, if we look
at the whole arc of human history, the one thing that's
systematically changed is that more and more gets automated. And LLMs just gave us a dramatic
and unexpected example of that. So what does that mean? Does that mean that in the end,
us humans will have nothing to do? Well, if we look at history, what seems to happen is that when
one thing gets automated away, it opens up lots of new things to do. And as economies develop, the pie chart of occupations
seems to get more and more fragmented. And now we're back to the ruliad. Because at a foundational level, what's happening is that automation
is opening up more directions to go in the ruliad. But there's no abstract way
to choose between these. It's a question of what we humans want, and it requires kind of humans
doing work to define that. So a society of AI as sort of
untethered by human input, would effectively go off
and explore the whole ruliad. But most of what they do would seem
to us random and pointless, much like most of nature
doesn't seem to us right now, like it's achieving a purpose. I mean, one used to imagine that to build
things that are useful to us, we'd have to do it kind of step by step. But AI and the whole
phenomenon of computation tell us that really what we need is more just to define what we want. Then computation, AI,
automation can make it happen. And yes, I think the key to defining
in a clear way what we want is computational language. And, you know, even after 35 years, for many people, Wolfram Language is still sort of
an artifact from the future. If your job is to program,
it seems like a cheat. How come you can do in an hour
what would usually take you a week? But it can also be kind of daunting
because having dashed off that one thing, you now have to conceptualize
the next thing. Of course, it's great for CEOs and CTOs and intellectual leaders who are ready
to race on to the next thing. And indeed, it's an impressively
popular thing in that set. In a sense, what's happening
is that Wolfram Language shifts from concentrating on mechanics
to concentrating on conceptualization, and the key to that conceptualization
is broad computational thinking. So how can one learn to do that? It's not really a story of CS, it's really a story of CX. And as a kind of education, it's more like liberal arts than STEM. It's part of a trend that when
you automate technical execution, what becomes important
is not figuring out how to do things, but what to do. And that's more a story
of broad knowledge and general thinking than any kind of narrow specialization. You know, there's sort of an unexpected
human centeredness to all of this. We might have thought that with
the advance of science and technology, the particulars of us humans
would become ever less relevant. But we've discovered that that's not true,
and that, in fact, everything, even our physics, depends on how we humans
happen to have sampled the ruliad. Before our physics project, we didn't know if our universe
really was computational, but now it's pretty clear that it is. And from that, we're sort of
inexorably led to the ruliad, with all its kind of vastness so hugely greater than the physical
space in our universe. So where will we go in the ruliad? Computational language
is what lets us chart our path. It lets us humans define
our goals and our journeys. And what's amazing
is that all the power and depth of what's out there in the ruliad
is accessible to everyone. One just has to learn to harness
those computational superpowers, which kind of starts here, you know, our portal to the ruliad. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #goals","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'sports', 'success', 'motivation', 'personal growth', 'goals', 'Emmanuel Acho']",2023-09-07T04:00:09-07:00,2023-09-07T04:00:09-07:00,People & Blogs,"I do not suppose to know everything. And those closest to me, they might say,
I don't really know much at all, but -- One thing that I know to be true
beyond the shadow of a doubt is this. The surest way to fail in life is to set a goal. (Laughter) Now, unfortunately, I found this out
through excruciating pain, but hopefully in the next nine minutes,
I can convince you, too, that this is true, without the pain. Unless, of course, you consider
listening to me painful. OK. The year was 2011. I was seeking to become
a multimillionaire by the age of 21. So how was I going to do this? It was simple. I was going to leave college
at the University of Texas one year early. I was going to leave after my junior year and declare for the National
Football League draft. In order to do this, however, you have to submit your resume to the NFL. A resume in football, it is your highlight tapes
from your years playing prior. So I submitted my football tape
from my freshman, my sophomore and my junior year. The NFL sent me back a letter. It simply read, ""Dear Emmanuel, you will not be drafted
in the first three rounds."" Excuse you. I won't be drafted
in the first three rounds? So what did I do, TED audience? It's simple. I set a goal that day. But you know what they say
about goal-setting. You've got to write it down,
commit it to memory. So I highlighted the sheet of paper. “Dear Emmanuel, you won’t be drafted
in the first three rounds,” and I put it above my bed
in my condo in Austin, Texas. Every morning I woke up, I looked at it. ""Dear Emmanuel, you won't be drafted
in the first three rounds."" Every night before I went
to sleep, I looked at it. ""Dear Emmanuel, you won't be drafted
in the first three rounds."" I worked tirelessly
my senior year in college with one goal in mind. Be drafted in the first three
rounds of the NFL draft. Those are the most prestigious
rounds after all. 6am workouts in college,
study hall, class. I'm doing it all, with one goal in mind. Well, fast forward one year later, I'm at the NFL Combine. The NFL Combine, it is the job interview. I'm in front of 32 billionaires. 32 of the richest men in America, if not the richest men in the world. They are the owners of every NFL team. I'm running the 40-yard dash. The 40-yard dash is one of the testing
metrics you use at the NFL Combine with millions of dollars on the line. The faster you run,
the higher you get drafted. I take my mark. I proceed to run. I hear pop, pop, pop. I keep running. I think my heels are clicking. Pop, pop, pop. I clutch my quad, I fall to the ground. It was my quad being torn off the bone. (Audience: Oh!) I ripped my quad off the bone, I’m falling [to the] ground in agony in front of these 32 billionaires. I didn't get drafted in the first
three rounds of the NFL draft. I made a decision that day,
in that moment, to stop setting goals. My self-esteem, ruined. Self-efficacy, ruined. That last year of my life
seemingly gone to waste because I had one goal, y'all. It was simple. Be drafted in the first three rounds. Then I tore my quad,
and it all fell apart. What I failed to mention thus far
is why I tore my quad. Two days prior at the NFL Combine, I weighed in at 240 pounds. In the NFL, the bigger
you are, the better. But as you all know, weight, it don't move all that fast. So I cut 10 pounds within two days. I ran the 40-yard dash
two days later at 230 pounds, dehydrated, dieted for two days. Why? Because I was so focused on my goal that I caused harm to myself. It's not that goals don't add value. It’s just that the risk of goal-setting, it is greater than the potential reward. Think about it in your own
life for a moment. Maybe you had the goal
of being in a relationship. So you ignore the toxic behavior. Think about it in your own life. See, one of my greatest
accomplishments to date, being an NFL player, because ultimately
I did play for four years, I view negatively because I didn't hit my goal. Maybe that's the same for some of you. Maybe you have the goal of reading
a certain amount of books in a year. You've become a much more proficient
reader, but you didn't hit your goal. Maybe you had a goal of making a certain
amount of money for your business. You are a thriving entrepreneur,
but you didn't hit your goal. I left the NFL. I became a content creator where I would live
a much more limitless life. I'll get to that more here in a moment. The question now is why
in the world do we set goals? Well, first, let's define a goal. A goal, by definition, it is the end towards which effort is aimed. But why would I start something
with the end in mind? In working on my master’s degree
in sports psychology, I focused on goal-setting,
I wrote my final thesis on it, and I realized we set goals
for three primary reasons. The first. We've been indoctrinated with this belief
that we have to set a goal to achieve. There's a popularized study,
which has since been debunked, which said the person
who writes their goals down and commits them to memory, they will earn twice as much money
as the person who doesn't. So what you want me to believe is the difference
between one million dollars and 500,000 dollars is this? What you want me to believe is the difference between 100,000 dollars
and 50,000 dollars is simply this? Can't be. Now, these ideas
aren't completely off-base. The problem is very simple. They're misidentifying
causation and correlation. Surely there is a correlation between the person who was willing
to go the extra mile and write their goal down and the person who's willing to go
the extra mile in their business. But no, the reason you're making
twice as much money is not because you wrote your goal down. The second reason we set goals, goals give us a North Star. Motivation. As if we'd just be wandering
around life aimlessly if we didn't set a goal. The final reason we set goals? We have this insatiable
desire for feedback. And feedback, it is a predecessor, is a necessary
aspect of goal-setting. Think about it in your own life. Did this Instagram post get as many
likes as that Instagram post? Did this tweet get as many likes
as my last tweet? How about this TikTok post? Did it get as many shares as my last? We have this insatiable
desire for feedback. You know, I made a mistake earlier. I said the surest way
to fail in life is to set a goal. But in all honesty, the only way to fail in life
is to set a goal. Think about anything
you've ever failed at. Maybe relationally,
occupationally, educationally. That marriage, it ended in divorce. You didn't get into that college
that you wanted to. You didn't pass the MCAT,
you didn't pass the LSAT, whatever the case may be, it was all tethered to a goal. It's not just that the surest way
to fail in life is to set a goal. The only way to fail in life
is to set a goal. So what do I suggest we do instead? Here it is. You have an objective with no limitations. Now I know what you're thinking,
Acho, that's semantics. No, this small difference will have
a huge impact in your life. Objective: effort aimed in a direction. A goal: the end towards which
energy is aimed. Your objective, it should be subjective. It should be subject
to people's interpretation. That way you do not fail. The theme of this conference
is Possibilities. You all have spent money,
left your homes, maybe children, because somewhere deep down inside you, you subscribe to this notion
of possibility. But you can't simultaneously subscribe
to the notion of possibility while still being held captive
by goal-setting. The laws of goal-setting completely
undermine the freedom of possibility. So if we're being honest with ourselves,
we have to choose one. Because possibility is limitless. But goal-setting, oh,
it’s fixated on an end. If you want to have
a 10-million dollar business, you'll set that goal. And you might do just that. Have a 10-million dollar business. Congratulations. You'll work towards
a 10-million dollar business. But what if it could have been more? If you want to run a mile
without stopping, you’ll work towards it,
and you might do just that. Having never known
if you could have run a marathon. What does it look like practically? Kirk Hammett, lead guitarist
for Metallica, he never had the goal
of winning eight Grammys. He never had the goal
of selling 125 million records, never had the goal of being a rock star. He simply said, and I quote, ""I just want to play my guitar
a little bit better every day."" Close quote. See, because with that, there is no end. A goal, by its definition,
it is focused on an ending, which means inherently a goal is limiting. It's not that goals in
and of themselves have no value, it's just, what about the damage
you have done to yourself, your self-esteem, your self-efficacy, the way in which you view yourself
when you look at yourself? What about that damage? I'm not saying don't achieve. I'm saying achieve limitlessly. I'm saying believe in the reason
you were all sitting in here today because you believe in possibility. Let go of the captivity of goal-setting and achieve all
you actually have to achieve. So what is my objective
with no limitations? Very simply put, to be considered one
of the most creative people the television industry has ever seen. Because if I would have achieved my goal of being drafted in the first
three rounds of the NFL draft, I never would have achieved this. Winning a Primetime Emmy Award
and sharing that moment with my mom. (Applause) But just as importantly, if I would have achieved my goal of being drafted in the first
three rounds of the NFL draft, I wouldn't be standing
in front of you all today. Why? Because if you hear nothing else, truly, if you hear nothing else, hear this. I'm begging each and every one
of you to hear this. The goal that you achieve, it's actually the penalty that you receive for having set that goal
in the first place. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

#TED #TEDTalks #sexualhealth","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'education', 'health', 'parenting', 'women', 'sex', 'TEDx', 'youth', 'Robin Buckley']",2023-09-28T04:00:29-07:00,2023-09-28T04:00:29-07:00,People & Blogs,"Six years ago, when my older daughter was 13,
I bought her a vibrator. (Cheers and applause) I'm done. OK. (Laughter) It wasn't something I planned on doing. I mean, I knew eventually my daughters
would need bras and tampons, maybe braces, but a vibrator was not on the list. So why did I do it? Before I explain why,
I want to acknowledge that I might have made
some of you a little uncomfortable or a lot uncomfortable. So before I explain why,
I want to ask you a question. Why are we more comfortable
talking about female pain -- things like period cramps, breast cancer, birthing pains, miscarriages and sexual assault -- than we are talking about female pleasure? Why does a vibrator make us uncomfortable but Viagra does not? (Cheers and applause) Getting my daughter a vibrator
started me on a journey of thinking about the importance
of empowering teenage girls, helping them to learn about their bodies and gain a sense of ownership
of their bodies, including embracing
their right to pleasure. This is one reason that my own daughters
encouraged me to include their stories in this talk. So I'm going to talk to you
today about sex, specifically in regards
to our teenage daughters. I know we don't like to think
about our teenagers having sex and because of societal double standards,
especially our girls. But here's why we need
to have this conversation, as uncomfortable as it may make us. Girls typically develop
a desire for sexual contact between the ages of 11 and 14. Between the ages of 15 and 19, 42 percent of them
have had vaginal and/or oral sex. Through the cell phones
right in their back pockets, 57 percent of girls and 84 percent of boys between the ages of 14 and 18 have watched pornography through
Pornhub and hundreds of similar sites. So if you have a kid in high school, it isn't a question of if they'll watch
porn before they graduate, but more likely, when. This means that a lot of our kids
are getting their sex education and trying to figure out
what's normal from pornography. To illustrate why we can’t leave our kids
alone to navigate this sexual terrain, I want to share a story with you. Several years ago, I worked with an incredibly
intelligent 14-year-old girl, helping her manage
her overall life stressors. During one session, she asked
if she could ask me a question about sex. She said that she was confused
about the bases and wondered if it was really true
that second base was anal sex. (Audience murmurs) I was as shocked as you are. And yes, when I asked her,
she did know what anal sex is. She had gotten her information
from watching a few porn clips her friends had showed her during study hall at school. Thankfully, because of the trusting
relationship she had with me, she was able to have this
misconception corrected and her anxiety about it relieved. With her permission, I was also able
to loop her mom in on the conversation so she could be a resource
for her daughter. I've worked hard to cultivate this type
of relationship with my own daughters. So when my 13-year-old said, “Mom, can I ask you a question?” ... kid speak for ""be prepared for anything,"" (Laughter) I listened. Which is why, sitting at a stoplight
on a summer morning, my daughter felt comfortable
telling me she had started to masturbate and was even willing to share with me
what she was using to do so. This is how I learned
that she was masturbating in a way that was not safe for her body. And so, in a span of one red light, I decided to buy my daughter a vibrator. I wanted to support her
in the safe exploration of her body instead of burying my head in the sand, which is so tempting to do as parents
with things that make us uncomfortable. When it comes to sex, we all need to become
trusted resources for our kids. They need to be comfortable
coming to us with questions and know they will get straight answers. And while this is certainly true
in regards to accurate information, sometimes it's also about giving
them the appropriate tool. When we talk about girls
knowing and exploring their bodies, it's easy to get uncomfortable. But girls becoming familiar
with their bodies is about health. Masturbation helps girls reduce stress, ease headaches and alleviate cramps
associated with their periods. When girls explore their bodies, they learn how their bodies feel
when they are healthy, which also helps them recognize changes
and potential problems. They have to touch their bodies
to know their bodies. This became clear to me when I was working
with one of my adult clients after her diagnosis
with stage four breast cancer. As we discussed her prognosis,
she said to me, ""Robin, if I'd only done my breast checks, maybe I would have caught it sooner. Maybe I wouldn't be dying."" But my client had been raised believing
that touching herself was inappropriate. On the few occasions
she did a breast check, she didn't know what was typical, and she rushed through them
feeling embarrassed. When girls are comfortable
touching their bodies, whether for self breast checks
or for pleasure, they learn about their bodies. And when they know their bodies,
they can better own their bodies. This is important when it comes to sex. Too often, others are dictating
what girls should expect, want and put up with. These expectations are being set
by pornography, social media, politicians and partners who are either
much more experienced or equally inexperienced. I mean, let's face it. What does the average teenage boy
know about the female clitoris or the female orgasm? (Laughter and applause) Given the statistics that about 15 percent
of women have never had an orgasm and 81 percent of women
do not orgasm through vaginal sex, it is important for our girls to know
that it's OK to figure out what gives them pleasure. And that they don't have to rely
on someone else for that pleasure. (Applause) This can help them make choices
which benefit them. As an example, another one of my clients
shared with me that she uses her vibrator before she goes on any date. (Laughter) This way, she can make judgments about the date based on the person and their connection
rather than on hormones. (Laughter) And then when our daughters do decide
to have sex with someone else, they will know enough
about their sexual pleasure to be able to communicate
what feels good to their partners. They won't have to follow
the outdated norms of tolerating unsatisfying experiences, faking it, or even believing
that their sole purpose is to serve someone else's pleasure. Our daughters will get the message that their wants and needs are important. Learning not to be ashamed
of their sexual pleasure is not limited to girls and young women. I worked with a 65-year-old woman
who had never, ever had an orgasm. She came to me for coaching
because she felt demoralized. She had recently retired
from her vice-president position, feeling pushed out by her company
as they hired younger executives. She had two goals for coaching. The first was to find
new ways to spend her time which gave her purpose. The second one was, and I quote, ""to try out an orgasm."" (Laughter) When she was ready, my client bought herself a vibrator and began learning about her body
for the first time in her life. I will never forget the day
when she came to our session, sat down demurely and said
with a big, beautiful grin, ""Second goal achieved."" (Laughter and applause) As she continued to learn about herself
and her sexual pleasure, my client stopped referring
to herself as old. She accepted a board position
for a national nonprofit. She even created a profile on eHarmony. (Laughter) Can I say it was simply due to the orgasm? Of course not. But in asking for more
from this one area of her life, she realized she could do the same
in other areas of her life. We can help our daughters
adopt this perspective long before my client did. We can support their
healthy sexual development, but even more, by doing so, we empower
their entire sense of selves. This is about helping our girls
step into their power, raising them to become strong women
who can speak up for themselves, whether they are in the bedroom
or in the boardroom. (Applause) Recently, my younger
daughter reminded me of just how well she can
speak up for herself. (Laughter) A few months ago, she was out with friends and called
to let me know and she'd be home. She's good like that. As we were wrapping up
the conversation, she said, ""Oh, by the way, mom, my vibrator broke. Can you pick me up a new one?"" (Laughter) Later on, she told me
that after she hung up, her friends said, ""We can't believe your mom
bought you a vibrator."" To which my daughter responded, ""I can't believe your moms haven't."" Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #work","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'business', 'social change', 'communication', 'community', 'motivation', 'society', 'TEDx', 'work-life balance', 'goals', 'leadership']",2023-07-19T11:12:20-07:00,2023-07-19T11:12:20-07:00,People & Blogs,"Over the past two years, how many times have you heard
that the times have changed or about the new normal? There’s no shortage of opinions about whether remote work
is for the better or spells destruction for our businesses. Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, said,
""I don't see any positives,"" whereas Suresh Kumar, CTO of Walmart,
said, ""We haven't just coped. We've actually thrived."" But what does the research say? How can we know, not just think,
that hybrid working actually works? There are so many questions. What's the right balance of work from home
versus work from the office? And who gets to decide? Is it managers, is it the employees? Is it both? How long can a given employee actually
remain productive working from home? Is there a limit? And who gets to work in each way? What should it be based on
in terms of criteria? Should it be based on seniority,
task, personal situation? The list goes on and on. So many questions and unfortunately, no simple answers. The reason these questions
are so hard to answer is because we're thinking about hybrid
work design as a single problem. One problem to solve, when in fact,
it's actually three different ones. The first problem is
are we able to effectively deliver on our stakeholder commitments? This is otherwise known
as the effectiveness debate. The second is will we be able to attract
and retain the talent that we need? This is the staffing discussion. And the third is can we maintain
or even cultivate, nurture, our culture? This is the talk about social fabric. Let's take a minute to highlight
the challenges inherent in each one. I've been working with a range
of organizations over the past two years, helping them determine what
their future of work should look like. Now, I'm not here
to make a broad statement that remote work is
or is not universally good. I think we're all
smart enough here to know that nothing works all of the time. I am, however, here to warn you
that we need to be wary of our data. Let me give you a couple of examples. Many people point to their organization's
effectiveness during COVID as proof that they're actually
good at remote work. Now it is proof that remote can work,
but not that it necessarily will. COVID was a massive social experiment
with unique conditions. Most organizations dealt with it
by cutting the fat and becoming laser-focused
on short-term efficiency. In effect, we were productive
because we were in survival mode. But the question we have to ask
is whether that's sustainable. Data shows around the world that people's working hours
have increased, and many say that they
actually find it harder to delineate work-life boundaries. Data also shows that the experience
wasn't the same for everyone. With “The Economist” data showing
that parents of school-aged children experienced much greater stress
than many others. And data from Microsoft shows
that it's actually even changing the way in which we work, with people working more hours
but less collaboratively. The question of whether
we can effectively work remotely needs a contextual answer. Contextual based on the people
who are doing the work and the tasks that they're
trying to accomplish. Remember, one size fits none, and we need to think
about the sustainability of our effectiveness. Now, when it comes
to the staffing discussion, ask anyone who has recently
been involved with hiring. The most common question that recruiters
are being asked these days: ""What is your flexible-work policy?"" In effect, we’re facing
the same escalation of perks popularized by tech companies
during the boom. Do you have a barista pulling
the perfect flat white in the lobby? Do you have nap pods?
A ball pit? A slide? What about on-site daycare, right? So then instead of work from home,
we actually bring home into work. Your current or potential future employees
are now weighing your hybrid work policy as a key criteria in their decision
of where they want to work. And that is the crux
of this staffing challenge. What you need to recognize is that the comparison isn't actually
between work from home and office work. Instead, it's really between
the perception of work from home versus the perception
of work from the office. And you need to reclaim that narrative. Let me give you a couple of examples. The first is what I call
the recovered commute. Many people have told me, ""I've saved so much time
now that I don't have to commute."" My challenge to them? What did you actually do
during your commute times? Maybe you read, maybe you caught up
on calls or emails, maybe you just use it
as time to decompress. Personally, I used to get an hour
to shake off a particularly rough, annoying, frustrating day
before I got home. Now it takes me exactly six seconds
to be immersed in my family upstairs. Another example, the after-meeting
postmortem debrief over a coffee, right? We use that to do some
relationship repair, maybe to do some collective sense-making. The most important thing to recognize here is that what matters most
is the experience, not just what the policy is. We need to reclaim the narrative to help
ensure that everybody recognizes what a given approach
either buys or loses for them. And this brings us to the social fabric. Think about what happened
when you joined your organization. You probably went to orientation. Maybe you looked around, you talked to some people, you observed and you learned
what it's like to work here. Why does that matter? Well, because our research
shows reductions in things like psychological safety and trust,
changes to power dynamics, increased feelings
of isolation and loneliness when we are working
remote from one another. Importantly, all of these
shape our cultures and make this conversation
even more difficult. And on top of that, social systems are dynamic,
emerging, evolving human systems. Now, I'm going to be honest,
I don't have the answer to this. And honestly, anybody
who tells you they do, they're trying to sell you something. We do know about different
approaches to building and establishing culture
in these contexts. What we have to recognize is they operate
in ways that may not be the same as the way we built culture
when we were face to face. What we have to remember here is that organizational culture
is a long game. What we do right now affects
the social fabric of our organizations and will have repercussions down the line. So when it comes to the social fabric, we need to think not only about today, but about tomorrow, next month,
maybe even next year. I hope you recognize that these are three
distinct conversations that are also not fully independent. We also have to recognize
what makes this challenging is that they are almost
ideologically different positions about what creates value
in your organization. Is it about the output
of what you produce? Is it about the people
in that organization or something in the ether, the culture? The first most important step
is getting these issues on the table, having an open conversation. And this is far from easy. But if you find yourself in disagreement
with somebody over these issues, whether it's a boss, a subordinate
or your leadership, I challenge you, ask yourself, do you really disagree
on how to create effectiveness, deal with staffing or the culture
of the organization? Or is it maybe just that you have
slightly different prioritization of those three different parts
of the whole hybridity conversation?"

#TED #TEDTalks #architecture","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'sustainability', 'Climate Change', 'design', 'architecture', 'art', 'resources', 'Vinu Daniel']",2023-08-08T04:00:11-07:00,2023-08-08T04:00:11-07:00,Science & Technology,"The construction industry accounts for 30 to 40 percent of the world's total energy and resources. It also accounts for 40 percent
of the world's total carbon emissions. A man who lived long before us
gave us a very simple solution. And he is Mahatma Gandhi,
the father of our nation, India. He said that the ideal house should be built with materials found in a five-mile
radius around the house. So you think, OK, what is that material? And it is right below our feet. It's mud. Now imagine, if we can build
a house with mud, there would be nothing more sustainable
or eco-friendly than that. But then, you might ask, how strong is mud? This compressed five percent
cement-added mud block, made by my alma mater,
Auroville Earth Institute, is twice as strong
as a country fired brick. In fact, it has a dry compressive
strength of 6.5 megapascal, as compared to a normal fired-brick,
which just has 3 to 3.5 megapascal. But then you may again ask, what about water? Wouldn't water destroy mud brick? This is a brick from the same institute kept in water since 1995, a little less than 30 years, and you can see that it can still hold
a significant amount of load. So what does this tell us? Can we change our perception
of construction? Can we imagine a new way of building? Or can we bring beauty to dirt? I demoted myself from being
an architecture graduate to being that of a mason. Or maybe I promoted myself, I don't know. I joined hands with local workers and started teaching them mud techniques. Very soon we started to change
every aspect of our construction. Our foundations became poured earth
or rammed earth, our walls became mud blocks
or compressed earth bricks. Why, even our roofs became domes
and vaults made of mud bricks. This is a brick wall residence
called Pirouette House, which we made in a very crowded community. So it goes in a zigzag pattern
in need of natural ventilation. Now, please remember
that this wonderful parametric form, or curves, were made not with any
computational technology, AI or robotic arms. These were actually made
with coconut twigs, thread and the masons' bear arms. At a time when the building
industry is fast moving towards a future that exceeds mankind, we brought the value
of human resources back into it. But way back in 2012, I was posed with a very
life-altering question. I was asked to build a residence,
a low-budget, eco-friendly residence for a primary school teacher
called Biju Mathew. And when I reached the site,
this was what I saw. A mountain of waste and debris dumped by the neighbors
after they finished their construction. And because there was no other empty plot. So what do I do? Do I stand back and allow
this waste to be dumped elsewhere? Or do I reimagine
the philosophy of building with materials found in my vicinity? Neither me nor the future
generations can unsee the waste that is getting piled in our vicinity. Therefore, we decided to use this waste as a part of our construction technique. We hand-pulverized this material, added a bit of soil and again, five-percent cement. And using the techniques
we learned so far, we kind of poured it in between two meshes and poured the entire mixture into it. The resultant product
was not just a formidable partition. It was load-bearing,
means these walls took the load
of the entire roof as well. But this came at a price. I was nicknamed “scrap engineer” by locals who found it amusing to see an engineer
search through scrap in the junkyard. But what I found
in the junkyard was pure gold: this is discarded electric meter boxes, washing machine wheels, decaying wood, all became part
of a new philosophy that included more and more waste. Thank you. (Applause) Now, emboldened by this, our new aim was to build
multi-storied mud and waste construction. Is that possible? Yes. This is Shikhara, a three-storeyed multi-story, mud and waste construction. We decided to further modify
what we did in the Biju Mathew residence. So instead of using two meshes, we put two wooden shutters and poured the same mixture
which we did in the earlier project. And the resultant product
was as strong as before and economical too. This wall had a dry compressive
strength of 4.5 megapascal. And mind you, this building,
this residence, we completed in a meager budget
of 90,000 dollars as compared to a general budget
of 200,000 dollars or more. Very soon -- (Applause) Very soon, many practices in the country started adopting this technique, not just because of its eco-friendly part, but also because it was cost-effective. For us Indians, born to traditional societies, very often, our dreams culminate
in lavish weddings and festivals. This, by the way, is a wedding stage. But the very next day,
this too, is a common scene. India discards 3.6 million tons of plastic every year. Therefore, we decided
to utilize plastic bottles as a part of our construction
for a new project called Chuzhi. It's a housing project. And in this project,
we started to build circular beams using plastic bottles and reinforced
concrete and of course, mud. We started to build it in circles. To be honest, we didn’t know
how this would eventually look, but we still kept on building the circles. (Laughter) We made it stable
and put a roof on top of it. You can see how weird this looks. Chuzhi is a project
that resides in a rocky terrain. And it's populated
by a lot of trees and shrubs. Now, generally, these two factors are attributed
as very bad things for construction. People generally cut trees or clear them to make spaces for their
rooms or buildings or whatever. But in here, the trees not only form shelter but also cool the building
in a tropical climate. And as far as the terrain was concerned, generally, people would fill it up,
level it, clear it and build on top of it. But here, the building is perfectly camouflaged in the rocky terrain, that 10 metres away from this project,
you will not see it. That is how good it is camouflaged. In this project -- (Applause) We managed to use 4,300 plastic bottles which would have otherwise
ended up as a landfill or even worse, in the ocean. One day, we all got sick
working at the site. We had breathing difficulty
and we kind of went to the doctor. And the doctor very calmly said, ""Ah, it must be the burning tires
used in road construction. Stay away."" And we were shocked. There are hundreds of kids
who travel these roads every day to their schools. There are thousands of families
who traverse these roads every day to their jobs, why some of us even stay on these roads. And the answer is stay away. Upon further investigation, adding to our worst nightmare, we found out that our country discards half a million tires in a day. (Audience murmurs) No, no, I'm not done yet. And the rest of the world discards
another half a million tires to India on the same day. (Audience murmurs) Yeah. This is an aerial pic of a tire dump, seen from space. This is in a GCC country, that collects the tires
from all of you guys, and eventually, dumps it
in countries like India. Now you should remember, all of these tires, most of them at least, eventually end up either
in the road tarring illegal process or we end up burning it
to make again fuel oil, because this is a petroleum product. Now, one way to neutralize
this huge toxic threat is to use it as part of construction. Now inspired from architects
like Michael Reynolds, we introduced mud and tire to form a new building
construction technique. And now we are building residences, we are building museums, schools. And this is the best way
to neutralize this threat and create beautiful construction. We believe that tomorrow this may also be the alternative for the housing crisis
that is a big reality for many of our underdeveloped countries. The heart of every project of ours lies with the problems
that we created amongst us. Discarded tires, plastic bottles, construction debris. None of these things
should be dumped thoughtlessly or carelessly. The world can not just find a solution, but we can even find beauty in this disaster
that we created for ourselves. I remember a single line by the poet of my native language, Ulloor, and it goes like this. (Speaking Malayalam) And it translates to this: It is our choice whether to build heaven or hell on Earth. Thank you, thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'business', 'future', 'work', 'money', 'work life', 'work-life balance', 'The Way We Work', 'Shahar Erez']",2023-10-03T10:09:20-07:00,2023-10-03T10:09:20-07:00,Science & Technology,"What does job security really mean? It means financial stability. Waking up and knowing ""I can provide
for myself and my family."" A freelance career can 100 percent
provide that if you build it wisely. As counterintuitive as it may seem, freelancing may be the best way
to build long-term stability. [The Way We Work] Five out of 10 American
workers watching this will have a freelance career by 2025. That's just two or three years out. Some of us will perform tasks like making
deliveries or doing remote data entry, and some of us will be writers,
graphic designers, product specialists, marketeers, software engineers,
data analysts or business consultants who are paid per project
and not tied to any one company. Having a freelance career
gives you the power to get your true market value and the flexibility to build life
the way you want it. But most importantly, it gives you
control over your future, making you less reliant
on a single employer. Hiring freelancers is good
for organizations, too. When freelancers come on board, they come with knowledge
from multiple employers. Freelancers also tend to be more
up-to-date on their skills. They constantly read, listen and learn
new approaches to remain employable, and freelancers offer a jolt of energy. They arrive ready to hit
the ground running. So how can you be part
of this freelance future? Here are some steps. Step one: Identify your core value. Talk to people in your network
of current and former employers and ask them what qualities
make you someone who's worth hiring? Are you thorough or fast? Are you strategic? What types of projects
do you really excel at? Figure out exactly what value
you bring as a freelancer. Step two: Communicate it to employers. Once you know your value, you're in great place
to approach potential employers, whether it's places
you've worked with in the past or other businesses
in the same industry and say, ""This is what I will do for you and this is the impact
it could have on your business."" Make your value clear
on your LinkedIn profile and on your personal website and ask to be paid what you're worth, which means you should do
some research on pricing and your value should
translate into your fees. Step three: Nurture early relationships. In the beginning, it's often in your best interest
to take whatever jobs you're offered. It's not all going to be great or easy,
but you will learn so much. You'll start to see that you're better
working with mission-driven companies or with managers
who don't beat around the bush. Or whether you're happier working remotely or going into an office
working with peers. Every time you finish
working with a new client, ask them for feedback. Find out what worked well. What can I do better? As a freelancer, you need to be proactive
and find ways to improve. It will not only make you better, but help raise your value
in the marketplace. Step four: Grow your client
base over time. As a freelancer, your existing customers
are your best references. When a project is about to end, ask whether they know others
who might benefit from your services or ask if they can promote you
and your work in their internal channels, social media platforms or email groups. Don't be discouraged. It takes time and consistency
to build a stable of clients. Put your focus on building
a reputation for good work and you'll eventually have to turn down
more jobs than you can accept. Step five: Join a freelance community. Whatever type of freelancer you are, find ways to connect
with others in your field. What are the LinkedIn
or Facebook groups to join? Which events to go to
and which podcasts to listen to? This community will not only help you
learn and give you leads on work, but it will also contain peers
that you can vent to when you need it. If you're interested in freelancing, don't wait until you get fired
or laid off to make that leap. Remember, when you rely on one employer,
they own your future. But by building
your freelance capabilities, you'll have the power to decide
not only who you want to work with, but when and in what capacity. And when downturns come, you'll be better able to withstand them with a network of people
who are excited to work with you."

These are artificial corals
created by a generative AI algorithm, trained with more
than 100 million coral images. Across the globe, sea water is becoming less habitable
due to the climate change and the coral reefs are dying rapidly. One day we might be only left
with the simulations of corals in a virtual world. With this project, “Coral Dreams,” our aim is to use AI and try to create artificial realities
while preserving disappearing nature. I'm a media artist and director. My team and I have been using
generative AI as a collaborator for seven years, although it feels like 70. We train machine-learning algorithms
by harnessing large, focused and publicly available data sets and visualizing what I call
humanity's collective memories, such as nature, urban and culture. Since [the] pandemic, my focus has been to compile
the largest data sets and artificially preserve nature. I am optimistic about generative AI because of its potential
for enhancing our memories. We as artists can utilize this potential
not only to represent nature, but also to remember how it feels
to be immersed in it in a digital age. Generative AI creates possibilities
to train algorithms with any image, sound, text and even scent data. For example, this is “Floral Dreams,” an algorithm trained with more
than 75 million floral images of 16,000 species. By using more than half a million
scent molecules, we were able to create
the scent of these dreams. Now let's please imagine a living archive that we can walk into. A universe that is constantly reimagined,
[reconstructing] its forms, patterns, colors and scents. Our life is becoming increasingly
rooted in digital worlds, and the boundaries
between physical and virtual, technology and nature, are blurring. Generative AI helps us
to create new realities and also project onto reality
through possibility space. Can we go to that space? Can we fill it with our
feelings, our senses? Large language models
are just the beginning of a long journey of innovations
[which] will bring more possibilities. Soon, I believe we will
be exploring hyper models, text to image, to sound, to scent, to life. And a big challenge
using generative AI in art is how to provide
models with original data. For this project, “Glacier Dreams,” we decided not to use existing models. Instead, we decided
to collect our own image, sound, scent and climate data. By traveling to our
first destination, Iceland, we were able to capture the beginning
of our own narratives of glaciers. I also believe that AI's
capacity can be mapped onto the complex history of human wisdom
and consciousness in nature. Could we use AI to preserve and learn
about ancient knowledge in nature? This was one of the first
questions in my mind when I met with the wonderful leaders of Yawanawa tribe in Brazil, Acre,
Amazonia, in the rainforest. My mentors and heroes, Chief Nixiwaka
and his creative force Putanny, who oversee their cultural preservation
and ecological sanctuary. I became deeply inspired
by their ways of learning and remembering already existing
knowledge in nature. Together we started a new project, a respectful co-creation
and open-source AI rainforest model. With this model, generative AI can even reconstruct
extinct flora and fauna based on the tribe's deep
and collective knowledge. This project will help us, hopefully, to bring ancient wisdom
to our society respectfully. My hope is that one day AI becomes a mirror that can reflect
collective memories of all humanity. And I do believe that we can use it
to bring people of any age and culture, inspiration, joy and hope. Thank you. (Applause)"

will have been in prison for 1,000 days. Almost three years. I miss him every single day. I'm scared that my father won't be able
to come to my graduation ceremony or walk me down the aisle at my wedding. But if being my father's daughter
has taught me anything, it is to never succumb
to fear and sadness. And I've experienced both,
fear and sadness. One of the most fearful moments
of my short yet eventful life was on August 20, 2020. That day, I woke up
in my childhood bedroom in Moscow. Like many of us do
first thing in the morning, I rolled over to the bedside table
and reached for my phone. I looked at the screen and was surprised
at how many notifications I had. Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, you name it. My feeling of confusion started
to slowly turn into a sense of worry. Alexey Navalny had suddenly fell
unconscious on the plane and was taken to the emergency
room at the hospital. My heart dropped to my feet. Without blinking an eye,
I jumped out of my bed and ran to my parents' bedroom to tell my mom that I was able to look
after my younger brother, Zahar, while she was away. But by then, she was already
at the airport. The plane on which my father had collapsed had to make an emergency landing
in a city in Siberia. And after two days, an international uproar and my mom fighting tooth and nail
to get him out of there, he was finally transferred to the clinic
called Charité in Berlin, Germany. There, at the special laboratory
of the German armed forces, they confirmed that he was indeed poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent
of the Novichok group. He spent three weeks in a coma. And after months and months of recovery, he went back to work
with the Anti-Corruption Foundation. (Applause) Founded over a decade ago, the Anti-Corruption Foundation
has been doing incredibly important and dangerous work
of spreading information and exposing the corrupt nature
of the Russian government. We've produced over 500 investigations, helped organize hundreds of protests
in Moscow and run election campaigns. We provide free legal assistance
to those who, like my father, have been imprisoned for peacefully
protesting the regime. We've created a sanctions list of 6,000
government officials, propagandists, entrepreneurs, various artists and more people who've supported
and worked with Putin over the years. And the list works. Governments all over the world have used
our list when imposing sanctions. (Applause) Because Putin and his associates,
they live lavishly. They own condos in Miami
and penthouses in Manhattan. They own vineyards in France
and villas on Lake Como. They buy enormous yachts
and country houses with gold toilets. They buy private jets to send
their corgis to dog competitions. Yes, you heard that right. In 2016, the Anti-Corruption Foundation
had released an investigation that Russia's deputy prime minister
owned an undeclared jet valued at over 60 million dollars and used it primarily to send his dogs
to international competitions. All of this while most citizens in Russia scramble
and live on wages of under 200 dollars. According to independent polling
done by the ACF sociology center, only 15 percent of the population
believe in Putin's propaganda. That means that 85 percent
of the population either opposes the regime, doesn’t think it really affects them,
don’t follow politics or simply don't know what to believe. This is why we ask our supporters,
who are ordinary citizens, to spread our investigations and news
content to their family members, friends and loved ones, because we know that if we can reach
those who are on the fence or persuade those who have been
brainwashed by Putin, we'll get that much closer
to changing the regime. One of my favorite chants
my dad used to do during the 2011 to 2014 protests in Moscow was: “One for all and all for one.” This is a phrase
that we're all familiar with, but most of us often forget. Dictators like Putin want us to forget it. They want us to forget how strong
we can be when we work together. They want us to forget
how much we can accomplish when we stand side by side. Because it is that much harder
for any dictator to fight an international united front
than each of us individually. Now you might think to yourself,
""Dasha, why should I care about this? Geographically, United States
is quite far away from Putin. Is he really that threatening to us, or are you just trying
to raise unnecessary alarm?"" And to that, I want to respond
with another thought. If we don't stand up for them now, then who will be left
to stand up for us later? (Applause) Cyber attacks, spreading
of propaganda and disinformation, meddling in the elections, bribing your government officials. This has been and is continuing to happen. The West, Europe and the United States
have tried talking to Putin. And where did that get us? The illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and now a full-scale war in Ukraine. Tyrants and dictators
don't want diplomatic relations. All they want is power. I often catch myself thinking how I shouldn't have gone back
to school that fall. I should have stayed with my family
while my dad was recovering. I should have gotten on that plane
with him back to Russia and hugged him before he got unlawfully
and outrageously arrested at the airport. That day when he went back,
on January 17, 2021, thousands of people showed up
at the airport to support him. When I was younger,
I didn't really understand how my dad could be
so optimistic about the future. He was constantly threatened,
arrested, followed. Our family would be followed
by men dressed in all black, wearing baseball caps
and a ridiculous-looking fanny packs when we would go to the cinema. (Laughter) And after a while, my dad decided
to make a game out of it. Whenever we would get on the subway, we waited until the last moment
and quickly got out of the car right before the doors closed,
so that FSB agents were left behind. (Laughter) A unique childhood experience. (Laughter) I think one of the main reasons
for my dad's success is that he has always been incredible
at channeling his emotions into hard work and motivation. He wouldn’t get sad,
and he was certainly never afraid. Instead, he would get fired up. Fired up because he saw a group of ex-KGB
corrupt criminals come into power and destroy his country. Seeing that motivated him so much more to work that much harder to stop them. And that is what makes a true patriot. Of course I understand that, first and foremost, the change needs to come
from within the country. And that is precisely why,
knowing all the risks, my dad went back to Russia 996 days ago. Because he simply couldn't not go back. My dad is an incredibly courageous
and selfless man, and I can only dream
to be like him one day. He doesn't run or hide. And unlike my father, Putin is a coward. A coward -- (Applause) A coward who, with his cronies, can no longer hide from the consequences
of what they have done to my country and democracy around the world. And you, everyone who's sitting here today or watching this online, you can help. Now. You, unlike millions [and] millions of those who have been threatened
and murdered and silenced in Russia, you have a voice. Please don't take
your freedom for granted. Russia is my home. It’s where I was born. It’s where I grew up. It’s where I became the person I am today. And I will promise you that I will
continue to speak up, tell the truth, and I will continue fighting until Russia
is a free and democratic country. Thank you very much, free Alexey Navalny. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #clothing","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'sustainability', 'social change', 'consumerism', 'fashion', 'shopping', 'Countdown', 'Josephine Philips']",2023-09-22T04:00:10-07:00,2023-09-22T04:00:10-07:00,People & Blogs,"I'd like to take you all back
to the late 1950s in Sierra Leone. My 93-year-old grandmother
is about my age. She lives in Freetown. It is hot and she is beautiful. She goes to a market one day
and she buys a yellow dress. It has stripes down it and an orange
tie attached to the collar. It is also beautiful. My grandmother Isa
is married to my grandfather, Harry, and this dress is the favorite
of all her dresses because it's shorter than the rest, meaning he gets to see more of her legs. (Laughter) She wears it a lot
for herself and for him, and she brings it with her in the 1960s
when she comes to England. Flash forward six decades and I'm sitting with her in her room
in the summer of 2018 and she gives this dress to me, entrusting me with its 60-year-long story. And in doing so, she teaches me
an unshakable lesson about what it means
to truly value what we own. That lesson meant everything to me. It meant everything when I went to work
at a second-hand clothes tech company and it meant everything when I left
to start my own startup, SOJO, a fashion-tech solution
that's revolutionizing the clothing repair
and tailoring industry. And it continues to mean
everything here today. Valuing clothes that we own
is not the cultural norm. I've grown up as part
of the fast fashion generation, which is all about overconsumption
and hyper disposability of clothing, meaning we buy way too much and we throw it away
without a second thought. Think, ""Oh, I've worn
that top on Instagram, so I don't want to wear it again."" Or, ""This shirt has ripped, so I'm going to chuck it
and get a new one."" Or, ""I've got a date lined up on Friday,
so I'm going to buy a new outfit."" This is how we've been taught
to engage with our clothes. This is how I used to think. But engaging with clothing in this way
has an absolutely devastating cost, a side we in the global North
so rarely get to see. That top from that Instagram post
that went to a charity shop instead of being reworn, it could have ended up
as one of 15 million items arriving to the shores of Ghana each week. Or it could have ended up
on the mountain of clothes in the Atacama Desert
in Chile, a pile so big, it's now viewable from space. Fashion waste levels have reached
92 million metric tons. To put that into perspective, because sometimes big numbers
are really hard to conceptualize, if you took every single person
that lived in Europe, we're talking hundreds
of millions of people, and you brought them all together and you put them all on one
massive weighing scale, they still wouldn't be as heavy as the amount of clothing waste
we're producing annually. And it's growing and it's unsustainable. But fashion waste
is only one side of the coin. We are producing so many clothes that the fashion industry's
carbon emissions each year are more than all
international air travel. So the question is, how do we go about generating
less fashion waste and in turn reduce the amount
of clothes we're producing? Well, to me, the answer is simple. When we value clothes correctly, we care for them, we repair them, we alter them to fit us,
even if our bodies change, we don't just throw
them away and buy more. But how did I, and how do we all, go about changing our mindset
away from one of disposability and towards one of value and longevity? Well, I'd like to take you
to look at my sister's jeans. My sister loves these jeans ever since my parents bought them
for her 15 years ago before a trip to Copenhagen. My sister is an artist. There's nothing she loves more
than to wear these jeans when she paints. They're comfortable, durable, and she even uses them as a place
to wipe her paintbrush. Now these jeans are made of denim,
which is a natural fabric. A lot of water, time and care has gone
into making these jeans, the time and care of many garment workers. They have value, but their value has only grown over time as there are bits of paint on these jeans
that match paintings around the world. Think, there's a bit of yellow over here that matches yellow
in a painting in a gallery in Korea. Or a bit of red on this side that matches
a painting in a home in Miami. How incredible is that? My sister's worn these jeans so much that she's had to use SOJO
to get them repaired twice, making them even more hers
with every patch, making them even more valued
with every stitch. There is so much beauty and power
in repairing and caring for our clothes. So often sustainability can be about
the need to give something up. But for me, sustainable fashion
isn't about losing anything. It's about gaining a deeper and truer
happiness with the clothes that we own. More connection, more appreciation,
and more intentional and personal joy. I think we can all agree that my sister
should not throw these jeans away. But that's just one example. (Applause) But that's just one example. This pair of trousers
that I've had tailored to fit that I'm now wearing on the stage at TED, they shouldn't be thrown away either. Neither should that dress that I bought
a couple of summers ago with my best friend on a sunny day
in a Camden charity shop. Neither should that jumper
that I was wearing when my dad looked at me
and said he was proud of me. Clothing can just be clothing. It can be a quick fix, a passing trend, a forgettable item that we wear once
for that random date. Or it can be something thoughtful, a material, style and shape
that works for us, something we want to wear
over and over again and something that embodies the story and the experiences of our life. Every single one of us
is wearing clothing. So I want you to stop
for a second and think. That top, those trousers. Do you know which field
in which country across the world grew that amazing cotton? Which woman with what family
and what life sewed your seam together? Where have you worn those clothes? What experiences have you had in them? Will you still have them
in 60 years' time? Why wouldn't you? Imagine if when you were
giving an item away, you saw the entire
creation journey of that item. And you saw all the times
that you'd worn it. There is no denying that responsibility for this unsustainable system
that we live in lies with governments, legislation, corporations and brands. But there's also no denying that we are the ones doing
the insatiable amounts of buying and we are the ones
doing the throwing away. And with that, there is so much
power and opportunity for us to collectively move ourselves
away from a culture in which what we buy is easily thrown away and instead move us to a culture in which what we buy
is loved and valued more. I've just been talking
about clothing today, but really I could be talking
about anything as our problems of overconsumption
and waste go far beyond just the clothing industry. We need to buy less stuff and we need to look after what we buy. It will mean less global waste, less global production and a reduced
negative impact on this planet. Valuing the things that we own
is a climate solution. So next time you buy something -- (Applause) So next time you buy something, maybe it's a pair of jeans
for a trip to Copenhagen, or maybe you're in a market
in Sierra Leone and you come across a yellow dress, I want you to think ""Do I need this?"" ""What has it taken for this item
to get here to me in my hands?"" ""What story can I create
alongside this item?"" And ""Will I really, truly value it?"" Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'science', 'technology', 'health', 'medicine', 'medical research', 'human body', 'Anna Greka']",2023-09-29T04:00:40-07:00,2023-09-29T04:00:40-07:00,Science & Technology,"I'd like to begin by telling you a story. It's a short story about a special family. In 1960, a Utah man
by the name of Roscoe Nelson, a father of six, died suddenly of unknown cause. He was 43 years old. As a surgeon himself, Dr. Nelson knew that
his progressive kidney failure would ultimately take his life. But he was in the dark as to the cause, and he had no access to treatment. Within two decades, tragedy struck again
when four of Roscoe's six children also developed kidney failure. Looking back as far back as the 1800s, every generation in this family
has been struck down at a young age by a mysterious and vicious disease. What could be the cause? Fast forward to 2013. A team of brilliant geneticists identified the cause
of Roscoe Nelson's deadly disease. It was a mutation, a single extra letter in the DNA, hiding in a dark corner
of a gene called MUC1. The mutation had been passed down
from generation to generation, leading to early deaths
from kidney failure. The discovery of this mutation
ended a decades-long diagnostic odyssey for this family
and many families like them. Now, as a physician-scientist
and cell biologist at Harvard, I have learned that studying this disease and genetic diseases like it is not only important to the families
they so tragically affect. This work is a critical scientific
and research priority for all of us. Why? Because what my team and I uncovered
by studying this seemingly obscure disease is a series of portals
into the inner workings of human cells, gaining unexpected insights
into fundamental biology. And best of all, we uncovered
incredible opportunities for the treatment of not one
but many dozens of diseases. You see, the amazing thing about science, the reason I love what I do is that if you follow your curiosity, it can lead to untold
scientific treasures. So in essence, my big idea
for you today is ... sleuthing. Not the kind that solves crimes, but the kind that solves
scientific mysteries, what I call molecular sleuthing or what is otherwise known
as hypothesis-driven science or curiosity-driven science. It is an idea as old as Aristotle, who was born more than 2,400 years ago, not far actually
from where I was born and raised, in Thessaloniki, Greece. Aristotle taught that at the foundation
of any scientific pursuit is formulating a hypothesis, asking a question
that can be tested experimentally. Sleuthing of this nature
is central to the scientific method and has led humans to amazing discoveries. So how did molecular sleuthing
help us unlock the secrets of the vicious mutation
that killed Roscoe Nelson? Well, once the mutation was uncovered, the next question was how can a single extra letter in the DNA
lead to so much trouble? My team and I got to work, using classical hypothesis-driven science, but with a twist. Our molecular detective work
is now supercharged by our ability to use modern,
scalable tools and technologies. Let me explain. To understand how a single extra letter
in the DNA can lead to disease, I must first remind you
of some basic biology. In nearly every cell in our bodies, the three billion letters
of genetic information, the DNA, is transcribed into RNA and in turn, RNA churns out proteins, which are the business end
of what our cells use to perform their basic functions. The engine that turns
DNA to RNA to proteins works tirelessly in each
of 37 trillion cells in our bodies. So normally the MUC1 gene
churns out a protein called mucin 1, which goes to the surface of cells and forms a protective
blanket around them. We hypothesized that the mutation
in the MUC1 gene is generating a mucin 1 protein that is not doing
what it is supposed to do. How could we test this hypothesis? A couple of decades ago,
when I was a student, this type of work would have involved
just a handful of petri dishes at a time. This meant that in a day’s work, I could really only test five or six
different experimental conditions to see how the cells responded. And then I had to spend
several long days at the microscope, taking images one by one,
analyzing them one by one, to finally make sense of the data. Instead, my students at Harvard and MIT have access to state-of-the-art
computer-controlled robotic systems and microscopes and artificial intelligence-powered
software, which enable them to analyze thousands of images, all in a day's work. As such, we can study cells
grown in special dishes that allow us to test hundreds
of experimental conditions at a time. In fact, I estimate
that our molecular sleuthing to date has generated more than 50 million images containing information derived
from more than 100 billion cells. That's as many cells
as there are stars in the Milky Way. And in the end, the vicious mutation
that killed Roscoe Nelson revealed its secrets. Remember, we hypothesized
that the mutation in the MUC-1 gene is generating a mucin 1 protein that is not doing
what it is supposed to do. Normally mucin 1 goes
to the surface of cells. However, we found
that the mutation in the MUC-1 gene is generating a mangled,
misshapen mutant protein that does not go to the surface of cells, but instead accumulates inside. This led to a new hypothesis. Is the mutant protein
getting trapped inside cells, and how does this happen? After some more molecular sleuthing, we learned that the misshapen protein
accumulates inside cells because of another molecule, a so-called cargo receptor. Thinking they're being helpful, these cargo receptors
grab the mangled proteins and throw them on board like cargo trucks carrying
a growing heap of nasty trash with nowhere to go. Unable to get rid of this toxic waste, cells begin to die, leading to the progressive kidney failure
that killed Roscoe Nelson. Well, now that we had insight
into the root cause of the problem, we could also look for a way to fix it. We went to work, testing thousands
of chemical compounds across millions of cell images. And in the end, we identified one compound that could
specifically remove the mutant protein. After some more molecular detective work, we learned that this drug-like compound can clear heaps of mangled proteins by steering the cargo trucks, the ones full of nasty trash, into the lysosome, the cell's trash disposal
and recycling facility, where proteins get shredded
into tiny pieces. The results were amazing. After giving the drug
to mice with kidney disease for one week, the mutant protein had
all but disappeared from these kidneys. And yet our greatest insight
was not our success in removing the mutant protein
from these kidney cells. We realized that our curiosity-driven work had solved a bigger
and much more important puzzle. This mysterious kidney disease was not so strange
or mysterious after all. In fact, we learned that it belongs
to a group of disorders collectively known
as toxic proteinopathies. You may have heard of some of them, all terrible, incurable diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's disease. OK. Now you can probably guess
what happened next. The incredibly talented
scientists on my team -- Here they are. They asked -- (Applause) Thank you. They deserve it. Thank you. They asked the next logical question. What if these cargo receptors, what if they grab and accumulate
misshapen proteins in different cells and organs in the body? What about the eye, for example? Their curiosity paid off because we are now learning
that this newly uncovered biology is operative in a form of blindness
called retinitis pigmentosa, which is caused
by a different misshapen protein accumulating in cells in the eye. In preliminary studies
shown here at TED for the first time, here is a mouse
I cleared of mutant protein. (Applause) And in ongoing studies,
we are finding that the same may be true for different misshapen proteins
accumulating in cells in the brain, causing some forms of Alzheimer's disease. In all, we estimate
that more than 50 disorders could be amenable to this approach. So understanding one disorder
has unlocked a nodal biological mechanism and insights for the treatment
of many more diseases affecting surprisingly distant
parts of the body, like the brain and the kidney. And so in our quest to save kidneys, we are now poised to save eyes,
livers, brains and more. And in our efforts
to save a handful of families, we can now save thousands more. Just think of the possibilities. If our work could unlock
treatments for thousands, imagine what solving
the next medical mystery can do. And the next one and the one after that. And remember, rare genetic diseases
are collectively common. They affect 10 percent
of all people in North America. That's hundreds of millions of people
all around the globe or 120 of you right here in this room. And yet, out of 8,000 genes
known to cause genetic diseases, we have only developed a treatment
for, at best, 500 of them. And this is not taking
into account disorders in which many genes
conspire to cause trouble, like schizophrenia
or cancer or heart disease. We have a lot of sleuthing to do, and yet this is the perfect moment to harness recently developed
scalable tools and technologies and take this challenge head on. And mind you, patients and their families
are up for the challenge, too. They're using social media
to organize and raise awareness, and they are becoming our true partners
on scientific journeys into the unknown. This is definitely true of the Nelsons. They have been our partners
for many years now. Here's the next generation of Nelsons. Our work has given them hope that their children
and their children's children can live longer, fuller,
and healthier lives. And they are proud to have ignited
a sleuthing revolution. From a few to more and more until we have precision cures for all. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #ai","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'science', 'technology', 'computers', 'future', 'AI', 'Machine Learning', 'Max Tegmark']",2023-11-02T04:00:48-07:00,2023-11-02T04:00:48-07:00,Science & Technology,"Five years ago, I stood on the TED stage and warned about the dangers
of superintelligence. I was wrong. It went even worse than I thought. (Laughter) I never thought governments
would let AI companies get this far without any meaningful regulation. And the progress of AI
went even faster than I predicted. Look, I showed this abstract
landscape of tasks where the elevation represented
how hard it was for AI to do each task at human level. And the sea level represented
what AI could be back then. And boy or boy, has the sea
been rising fast ever since. But a lot of these tasks have already
gone blub blub blub blub blub blub. And the water is on track
to submerge all land, matching human intelligence
at all cognitive tasks. This is a definition of artificial
general intelligence, AGI, which is the stated goal
of companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic. And these companies are also trying
to build superintelligence, leaving human intelligence far behind. And many think it'll only be a few years,
maybe, from AGI to superintelligence. So when are we going to get AGI? Well, until recently, most AI researchers
thought it was at least decades away. And now Microsoft is saying,
""Oh, it's almost here."" We're seeing sparks of AGI in ChatGPT-4, and the Metaculus betting site
is showing the time left to AGI plummeting from 20 years away
to three years away in the last 18 months. And leading industry people
are now predicting that we have maybe two or three years left
until we get outsmarted. So you better stop talking
about AGI as a long-term risk, or someone might call you a dinosaur
stuck in the past. It's really remarkable
how AI has progressed recently. Not long ago, robots moved like this. (Music) Now they can dance. (Music) Just last year, Midjourney
produced this image. This year, the exact
same prompt produces this. Deepfakes are getting really convincing. (Video) Deepfake Tom Cruise:
I’m going to show you some magic. It's the real thing. (Laughs) I mean ... It's all ... the real ... thing. Max Tegmark: Or is it? And Yoshua Bengio now argues that large language models
have mastered language and knowledge to the point
that they pass the Turing test. I know some skeptics are saying, ""Nah, they're just overhyped
stochastic parrots that lack a model of the world,"" but they clearly have
a representation of the world. In fact, we recently found that Llama-2
even has a literal map of the world in it. And AI also builds geometric representations
of more abstract concepts like what it thinks is true and false. So what's going to happen
if we get AGI and superintelligence? If you only remember one thing
from my talk, let it be this. AI godfather, Alan Turing predicted that the default outcome
is the machines take control. The machines take control. I know this sounds like science fiction, but, you know, having AI as smart as GPT-4 also sounded like science
fiction not long ago. And if you think of AI, if you think of superintelligence
in particular, as just another technology, like electricity, you're probably not very worried. But you see, Turing thinks of superintelligence
more like a new species. Think of it, we are building creepy, super capable, amoral psychopaths that don't sleep and think
much faster than us, can make copies of themselves and have nothing human about them at all. So what could possibly go wrong? (Laughter) And it's not just Turing. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,
who gave us ChatGPT, recently warned that it could
be ""lights out for all of us."" Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei,
even put a number on this risk: 10-25 percent. And it's not just them. Human extinction from AI
went mainstream in May when all the AGI CEOs
and who's who of AI researchers came on and warned about it. And last month, even the number one
of the European Union warned about human extinction by AI. So let me summarize
everything I've said so far in just one slide of cat memes. Three years ago, people were saying it's inevitable,
superintelligence, it'll be fine, it's decades away. Last year it was more like, It's inevitable, it'll be fine. Now it's more like, It's inevitable. (Laughter) But let's take a deep breath
and try to raise our spirits and cheer ourselves up, because the rest of my talk
is going to be about the good news, that it's not inevitable,
and we can absolutely do better, alright? (Applause) So ... The real problem is that we lack
a convincing plan for AI safety. People are working hard on evals looking for risky AI behavior,
and that's good, but clearly not good enough. They're basically training AI
to not say bad things rather than not do bad things. Moreover, evals and debugging
are really just necessary, not sufficient, conditions for safety. In other words, they can prove the presence of risk, not the absence of risk. So let's up our game, alright? Try to see how we can make
provably safe AI that we can control. Guardrails try to physically limit harm. But if your adversary is superintelligence or a human using superintelligence
against you, right, trying is just not enough. You need to succeed. Harm needs to be impossible. So we need provably safe systems. Provable, not in the weak sense
of convincing some judge, but in the strong sense of there being
something that's impossible according to the laws of physics. Because no matter how smart an AI is, it can't violate the laws of physics
and do what's provably impossible. Steve Omohundro and I
wrote a paper about this, and we're optimistic
that this vision can really work. So let me tell you a little bit about how. There's a venerable field
called formal verification, which proves stuff about code. And I'm optimistic that AI will
revolutionize automatic proving business and also revolutionize program synthesis, the ability to automatically
write really good code. So here is how our vision works. You, the human, write a specification that your AI tool must obey, that it's impossible to log in
to your laptop without the correct password, or that a DNA printer
cannot synthesize dangerous viruses. Then a very powerful AI
creates both your AI tool and a proof that your tool
meets your spec. Machine learning is uniquely good
at learning algorithms, but once the algorithm has been learned, you can re-implement it in a different
computational architecture that's easier to verify. Now you might worry, how on earth am I going
to understand this powerful AI and the powerful AI tool it built and the proof, if they're all too complicated
for any human to grasp? Here is the really great news. You don't have to understand
any of that stuff, because it's much easier to verify
a proof than to discover it. So you only have to understand
or trust your proof-checking code, which could be just
a few hundred lines long. And Steve and I envision that such proof checkers get built
into all our compute hardware, so it just becomes impossible
to run very unsafe code. What if the AI, though,
isn't able to write that AI tool for you? Then there's another possibility. You train an AI to first just learn
to do what you want and then you use a different AI to extract out the learned algorithm
and knowledge for you, like an AI neuroscientist. This is in the spirit of the field
of mechanistic interpretability, which is making really
impressive rapid progress. Provably safe systems
are clearly not impossible. Let's look at a simple example of where we first machine-learn
an algorithm from data and then distill it out
in the form of code that provably meets spec, OK? Let’s do it with an algorithm
that you probably learned in first grade, addition, where you loop over the digits
from right to left, and sometimes you do a carry. We'll do it in binary, as if you were counting
on two fingers instead of ten. And we first train a recurrent
neural network, never mind the details, to nail the task. So now you have this algorithm
that you don't understand how it works in a black box defined by a bunch of tables
of numbers that we, in nerd speak, call parameters. Then we use an AI tool we built
to automatically distill out from this the learned algorithm
in the form of a Python program. And then we use the formal
verification tool known as Daphne to prove that this program
correctly adds up any numbers, not just the numbers
that were in your training data. So in summary, provably safe AI,
I'm convinced is possible, but it's going to take time and work. And in the meantime, let's remember that all the AI benefits that most people are excited about actually don't require superintelligence. We can have a long
and amazing future with AI. So let's not pause AI. Let's just pause the reckless
race to superintelligence. Let's stop obsessively training
ever-larger models that we don't understand. Let's heed the warning from ancient Greece and not get hubris,
like in the story of Icarus. Because artificial intelligence is giving us incredible intellectual wings with which we can do things
beyond our wildest dreams if we stop obsessively
trying to fly to the sun. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #sustainability","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'sustainability', 'Hannah Ritchie', 'future', 'history', 'humanity', 'data']",2023-09-25T04:00:18-07:00,2023-09-25T04:00:18-07:00,Science & Technology,"It's become strangely normal to tell our kids that they're going
to die from climate change. If sea-level rise doesn’t get them,
then a wildfire will, or a global famine, or crop failures. Maybe a fatal heat wave, the insect apocalypse or the fishless oceans. These are the headlines we've all been told will be
the end of humanity. So we shouldn't be surprised, then, that young people today
feel crippled with anxiety. A large international survey
asked 10,000 young people about their attitudes to climate change. More than half said
they think humanity’s doomed; three-quarters find
the future frightening; and more than one in three are hesitant
to have children of their own. Young people today truly feel
like they could be the last generation. In fact, prominent activist groups
actually take on this very name. Now I get this feeling, I've been there. I used to feel like humanity was doomed, and despite having multiple
environmental degrees, I felt completely helpless
to do anything about it. But I'm a data scientist, and after years poring over the data
on how far humanity's come and how quickly things are now moving, my perspective on this has changed. I think we've got
this framing upside down. Far from being the last generation, I think we will be the first generation: the first generation to be sustainable. When we think about sustainability, we might imagine humans have only become
unsustainable in the very recent past, that our ancestors lived
in perfect balance with nature and only recently
has that been knocked off. Unfortunately, this is not true. If we're nostalgic for sustainable
paths to rewind back to, there is none. The world has never been sustainable. Now I get that that's
a controversial statement, so let me explain why. When we think about
the definition of sustainability, we might imagine something like this: ""having a low environmental impact
to protect future generations."" And it's true, by this definition, many of our ancestors were sustainable. They did have a low environmental impact. But the reason they had
a low environmental impact is because the populations were tiny. And the reason their populations were tiny is because half of children died
before reaching puberty. Half of children died. That, then, raises the question: Is that what we really think
sustainability is? Is that the world we want
to maintain and preserve, one where half of our children die? Hope your answer to that is no. If we care about human suffering, we need to add another dimension to this. We need to also provide a good life
for everyone today. Now that gives our definition two halves. If we fail on either half,
we have failed to be sustainable. That's where our ancestors
were never sustainable. They never achieved
the first half of the equation. And over the last few centuries, the world has made
amazing progress on the first half. As we've shown at Our World in Data, child mortality is now down
to four percent. Extreme poverty used to be the default,
now less than one in 10 people live there. Literacy and education used to be rare; now, most children in the world
get the opportunity to go to school. But the world as it is today
is still unacceptable. It's unacceptable that millions
of children die every year, that hundreds of millions live
on less than two dollars a day, which is an incredibly low poverty line. But pick almost any metric
of human wellbeing, and you'll find that the world
has become a much better place. But that progress has come at a cost. It's come at a cost to the environment. We burn wood and fossil fuels for energy. We expanded farmlands
at the cost of forests, and our insatiable appetite for meat means we now use half
of the world's habitable land for farming. We kill billions of animals every year. These are the trends
that make us feel doomed. We see these lines rising,
and we assume they might never stop. But more recent data tells us
a slightly different story. A more hopeful story,
that we can turn things around. This is per-capita CO2 emissions
in the UK since 1750. Over the last few decades,
emissions in the UK have halved. That means that my carbon footprint today is less than half that of my grandparents'
when they were my age. That's despite the fact
I live a much more extravagant lifestyle, or, as they'd put it, ""You youngsters just don't know
how good you've got it these days."" (Laughter) Now, you might think
the UK's cheating here. It used to be this industrial powerhouse, now it gets China, India and Bangladesh
to produce its stuff for it. Maybe it's just offshored
all these emissions. There's a bit of truth to this -- when we adjust for trade,
emissions in the UK are higher -- but we still see this dramatic decline
over the last few decades. Offshoring is a bit of the story,
but it's not the entire story. At the same time,
the UK has increased its GDP. GDP has gone up,
while emissions have come down. And it's not the only country
to achieve this. You will see the same
for the US, for Germany, France, Spain, Portugal. A long list of countries
have increased GDP while reducing their emissions. And again, this is not just
because they've offshored them. The notion that economic growth has to be incompatible with reducing
our environmental impact is simply wrong. Now rich countries
are reducing their emissions, but low- and middle-income countries
are increasing theirs. What does this mean at a global level? Well, total CO2 emissions
are now beginning to flatline, but actually, emissions per person
already peaked a decade ago. That means the emissions
of the average person in the world today have peaked, and are now falling. And we will see a peak
in total CO2 emissions soon. Now, why is this happening? A big driver has been
technological change. Here, we see coal production
in the UK since 1700. Now the UK was the birthplace
of industrial coal, and it has now died there. When I was born, more than half of the UK's electricity
was coming from coal. This is now less than two percent. And it’s dying
in many other countries too. You will see the same
for the US, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland. In many countries in the world,
coal is dying. Taking its place are renewables,
where costs are plummeting. The cost of solar has fallen
by 99.8 percent since 1970, fallen by 90 percent
in the last decade alone. And if you're worried that it looks
like this price trend is leveling off, don't be. When we zoom in, we see
that the price of solar continues to fall. And the same is true for wind. Go back a decade, and solar and wind were among the most
expensive energy technologies we had. That is why the world
was not making progress, that is why countries
were not deploying them -- they were far too expensive. But just ten years on,
and that script has flipped. In many countries in the world,
solar and wind are now the cheapest. Now if we're going to have renewables,
we're going to need energy storage. But there's good news there too. The price of batteries
has fallen by 98 percent since 1990. If you take the battery
you'd find in a Tesla today, go back to 1990, it would have cost
one million dollars. It now costs just 12,000. That’s completely transformed
the world of energy storage and completely transformed
the world of transport. Global sales of petrol and diesel cars
have already peaked -- they peaked in 2017,
and they are now falling. Taking their place are electric cars, where, in a space of just a few years,
sales are going through the roof. And from energy and transport
to the food we eat, you might imagine
that global deforestation is at its highest level ever. But actually, global deforestation
peaked decades ago and is now falling. But actually, it's better than that, because many countries
are now regrowing their old forests, such that the net decline
is even more impressive. Now, why is this happening? A big driver has been
increases in crop yields. For all of our agricultural history,
crop yields were low and stagnant. Farmers had basically
no opportunities to increase them. Over the last century, across many countries
and many different crop types, crop yields have skyrocketed. Here, we see it for the US, for corn, where yields have grown sixfold,
from two tonnes to 12 tonnes. Now what this means
is we can grow a lot more food from a lot less land. The amount of land
used to produce corn in the US has not increased in over a century, but look at the change in corn production. My main point here is that in the past, human progress had to come
at the cost of the environment. If we wanted energy, we had to burn wood
or we had to burn fossil fuels. If we wanted to grow more food, we had to expand farmland, often at the cost of forests. But technology and innovation means we're very quickly
decoupling these impacts, such that this conflict is no longer true. Let's then think about the world
that we can have. We need to achieve
the first half of our equation. We need to end global poverty. And here, I'm not talking
about raising everyone above a two-dollar-a-day poverty line. That is simply not good enough. We need to provide everyone
with a good, comfortable life. No child should die
from a cause that’s preventable. Every child should get the opportunity
to go to school and get an education. At the same time, we need to peak
and reduce our CO2 emissions; we need to move away from fossil fuels; and we need to end deforestation, while feeding eight, nine,
ten billion people, at the same time. How do we do that? How do we become the First Generation? First, our low-carbon technologies
need to become the default. There's two ways to do this. The first is to make sure
that they are affordable, to make sure that they are
the cheapest option. Solar and wind are already
cheaper than coal, electric cars will soon be
cheaper than gasoline, and alternative proteins
need to be cheaper than meat. The other way to do this is to make sure
these technologies are better. Environmental products have often been
promoted as this happy gimmick, but they need to go mainstream, and for that, they need to be better
than the high-carbon alternatives. Now my brother
recently got an electric car. He didn't get an electric car because he really cares
about the environment. He does not want to be
the next Greta Thunberg. And he definitely
does not want to be like me. (Laughter) He got an electric car because the design
and the driving experience were far better
than the petrol alternatives. That is how we make
low-carbon technologies the default. We need to reframe the way
we talk about sustainability as often promoted as a sacrifice. Environmental messaging
is often built on scarcity. It’s about reducing our lives
back to the bare minimum and no more. But this is not a vision
that inspires anyone. This is not the future we want to build. We need to reframe sustainability
as an opportunity, because it is an opportunity. It's an opportunity to provide clean,
abundant energy for everyone, whether that's powering
cities or countries, or getting rural communities connected
for the very first time. It’s about not being at the whims
of fossil-fuel markets or having millions
plunged into fuel poverty when dictators invade
neighboring countries. It's about breathing clean air. Here, we see the decline
in harmful air pollution in the US, from 2005 to 2021. Stopping people from dying
is not a sacrifice. Finally, it's a way to rethink
the way we live our lives, the way we design our cities
and our communities. Here, we see Copenhagen,
with bikes on the road, or Amsterdam, where you have
layer upon layer of bike rack. Now I'm not saying this is how
our cities have to look. We can design them in any way we want. What I'm saying is that sustainability
gives us the shelf to rethink the way we do things. Finally, we need to rethink
the way we use data. As a data scientist,
I take this very seriously. The environmentalists
have done an amazing job of waking the world up to these problems. Those charts of rising CO2
and rising temperature have been absolutely critical. They're why I'm on the stage today, they're why I got involved
in this in the first place. But there's a limit. When that's all we see,
we become paralyzed. We see these lines rising, and we assume that they might never stop. We assume that no progress has been made, that nothing good is happening. But as we've just seen,
this couldn't be further from the truth. We need to use data to inspire, to show what the problems are, also what the solutions are, and we need to show real signs of progress from countries, individuals, companies. Historically, our sustainability
equation went like this. It was one or the other. You could not have both at the same time. We can be the first generation
that does achieve both. Now the emphasis here is on ""can."" None of this is inevitable. It's not even inevitable that we'd have this opportunity
in the first place. We're only here
because of the relentless work of environmentalists, activists,
scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, communicators, determined to make
the world a better place. They have brought us here,
and we need to take that forward. We need to do it bigger, and we need to do it much, much faster. But we do have the opportunity to be the first generation
that builds a sustainable world. Let's take it. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #work","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'business', 'communication', 'work', 'personal growth', 'Gorick Ng']",2023-09-12T08:04:19-07:00,2023-09-12T08:04:19-07:00,People & Blogs,"In many workplaces, there are rules
that are completely unspoken. Understanding them is crucial for success, and yet you won't find them
in your employee handbook. Unless you're lucky enough
to have a mentor or manager who pulls you aside to help, you just kind of have to figure
them out on your own. [The Way We Work] Starting a new job can feel
like starting at a new school. You're meeting new people, you're getting thrown
into unfamiliar situations, and you’re constantly wondering:
What does everyone think of me? But whether you're starting
your first job ever or just starting a new role, making a great impression
doesn't have to be so scary. It all comes down to deciphering
those unspoken rules and demonstrating
what I call the three Cs: competence, commitment and compatibility. The first C is competence. On day one, your new colleagues
are probably looking at you and thinking: Can you do your job? The way to convince others, not to mention yourself,
that yes, you can, is to show your homework and to give others something to react to. Let’s say it’s your first day,
and it’s utter chaos. People are forwarding you messages with nothing more
than a ""See below"" at the top and pulling you into meetings
without any notice or context. Your manager just gave you a task, and two minutes in
you're already confused. Instead of going back to them
right away and saying, “I don’t know what to do next, help!” Or doing what I did, which is not asking questions at all, think about a similar task
that you tried in a previous job, in school or just for yourself. What steps did you take then? Then make your best guess
and just give it a try. Then go back to your manager and say, “I’m working on X, and I'm not quite sure of what to do next. I've taken X steps and spoken to so-and-so
and I understand this part, but I'm still unclear
about this other part. What do you think about this approach?"" No, I'm not suggesting
that you fake it till you make it, but what I am suggesting is that you try
until you can't try anymore. Time matters, though,
so give yourself a limit. And depending on your deadline,
figuring things out on your own. Then ask and then learn
from what others tell you. It's your first bit of knowledge
around how things work here. The second C is commitment. Besides looking to see
if you can do your job, your colleagues are also looking
to see if you're dedicated. During your first week in a new job, try asking your manager
questions about expectations. My favorites are one,
what are my top priorities in this role? Two, how would you like to communicate
day-to-day and week-to-week? And three, what have
your highest performers done that you'd suggest that I do too? For your peers, try to go more casual. In your first few days,
your manager will be probably, or well, at least hopefully, taking you around and introducing you
to your other teammates. In those moments, think about how you can transform
some of those ""Hi's"" into conversations and then those conversations
into relationships. One option is to ask
how others' weeks are going. For those you really get along with, try involving them in your work and maybe even your life
with phrases like, “Oh, I’d love to get your input on A.” Or “Could I get your advice on B?” These can all go a long way
in deepening a relationship. The third C, it's compatibility. Every time a new person joins a team, the others on it want to know:
Will you get along with us? By initiating conversations, you're already expressing compatibility. But while you're at it, use this time to try and identify
who's in charge of what or what I call “invisible swim lanes.” Let's say you've just started
a new remote job. First, ask your manager
if there's an org chart. It's a diagram showing
who reports to whom. And if there is one, amazing. But formal job titles and reporting lines can only tell you so much
about how things really work. So when you're in meetings
and group chats, pay attention. What's each person's role? Who reports to whom? Who's on whose side, who commands respect, which behaviors get rewarded
and which behaviors get punished? Understanding these norms,
loyalties, power brokers and swim lanes is what people are really referring to when they say that it’s important
to understand a team’s “culture.” And by the way, while you're
mapping out these swim lanes, look around to see if there's any
swim lane that might be unoccupied or in other words,
what tasks might be available that aren't currently being done that can help your team accomplish
more, better, faster, cheaper, safer, more securely. By doing this, you'll show that you're competent
enough to spot gaps, committed enough to fill them and compatible enough to not overstep. Here’s the reality of starting a new job. Doing your job is only part of it. The rest is about how
you get along with other people. But as much as we've been talking
about others sizing you up, don't forget to do the same. Is this an environment where you can
flourish and do your best work? Can you see yourself getting
along with your coworkers? Is this even work you're excited to do? Every job is a two-way street. You can do well
only if you want to do well. And if you're set up to do well. So look around, reflect and be honest with yourself about whether this
is a good place for you."

#TED #TEDTalks #ai","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'Technology', 'Design', 'Computers', 'Creativity', 'Art', 'AI', 'Beauty']",2023-09-01T04:00:36-07:00,2023-09-01T04:00:36-07:00,Science & Technology,"All right. Good afternoon, y’all. Let's talk about blending
reality and imagination. But first, let's take
a step back in time to 2001. As an 11-year-old in India, I became obsessed
with computer graphics and visual effects. Of course, at that age, it meant making cheesy videos
kind of like this. But therein started
a foundational theme in my life, the quest to blend reality
and imagination. And that quest has stayed with me and permeated across
my decade-long career in tech, working as a product manager
at companies like Google and as a content creator
on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. So today, let's deconstruct this quest
to blend reality and imagination and explore how it’s getting 
supercharged -- buzzword alert -- by artificial intelligence. Let's start with the reality bit. You probably heard about photogrammetry. It's the art and science
of measuring stuff in the real world using photos and other sensors. What required massive data centers
and teams of experts in the 2000s became increasingly
democratized by the 2010s. Then, of course,
machine learning came along and took things to a whole new level with techniques like
neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. What you're seeing here is an AI model creating a ground-up
volumetric 3D representation using 2D images alone. But unlike older techniques
for reality capture, NeRFs do a really good job
of encapsulating the sheer complexity and nuance of reality. The vibe, if you will. Twelve months later,
you can do all of this stuff using the iPhone in your pocket, using apps like Luma. It's like 3D screenshots
for the real world. Capture anything once and reframe it
infinitely in postproduction, so you can start building that collection
of spaces, places and objects that you truly care about and conjure them up
in your future creations. So that's the reality bit. As NeRFs were popping off last year, the AI summer was also in full effect, with Midjourney, DALL-E 2,
Stable Diffusion all hitting the market
around the same time. But what I fell in love with
was inpainting. This technique allows you
to take existing imagery and augment it with whatever you like, and the results are
photorealistically fantastic. It blew my mind because stuff that would have taken me
like three hours in classical workflows I could pull off in just three minutes. But I wanted more. Enter ControlNet, a game-changing technique
by Stanford researchers that allows you to use
various input conditions to guide and control the
AI image generation process. So in my case, I could take
the depth information and the texture detail from my 3D scans and use it to literally reskin reality. Now, this isn't just cool video. There’s a lot of useful use cases, too. For example, in this case I'm taking
a 3D scan of my parents' drawing room, as my mother likes to call it, and reskinning it
to different styles of Indian decor and doing so while respecting
the spatial context and the layout of the interior space. If you squint, I'm sure you can see how this is going
to transform architecture and interior design forever. You could take that 2016 scan
of a Buddha statue and reskin it to be gloriously golden while pulling off
these impossible camera moves you just couldn't do any other way. Or you could take that vacation footage
from your trip to Tokyo and bring these cherry blossoms to life
in a whole new way. And let me tell you, cherry blossoms
look really good during the day, but they look even better at night. Oh, my God. They sure are glowing. It's almost like this dreamlike quality where you can use AI to accentuate
the best aspects of the real world. Natural landscapes look just as beautiful. Like this waterfall that
could be on another planet. But of course, you could go
over the hills and far away to the French Alps from another dimension. But it's not just static scenes. You can do this stuff with video, too. I can't wait till this technology
is running at 30 frames per second because it's going to transform
augmented reality and 3D rendering. I mean, how soon until
we're channel-surfing realities layered on top of the real world? Of course, just like reality capture
got democratized, all these tools from last year
are getting even easier. So instead of me spending hours weaving together
a bunch of different tools, tools like Runway and Kaiber
let you do exactly the same stuff with just a couple clicks. Want to go from day to night? No problemo. Want to get that retro 90s aesthetic
from ""Full House""? You can do that too. But it goes beyond reality capture. Companies like Wonder Dynamics are turning video into this immaculate
form of performance capture so you can embody fantastical creatures
using the phone in your pocket. This is stuff that James Cameron
only dreamt about in the 2000s. And now you could do it with your iPhone?
That’s absolutely wild to me. So when I look back
at the past two decades and this ill-tailored tapestry
of tools that I've had to learn, I feel a sense of optimism
for what lies ahead for the next generation of creators. The 11-year-olds of today don't have to worry
about all of that crap. All they need to do
is have a creative vision and a knack for working in concert
with these AI models, these AI models
that are truly a distillation of human knowledge and creativity. And that's a future I'm excited about, a future where you can blend
reality and imagination with your trusty AI copilot. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'sustainabilty', 'future', 'energy', 'poverty', 'humanity', 'money', 'resources', 'Countdown', 'Avinash Persaud']",2023-08-18T04:00:07-07:00,2023-08-18T04:00:07-07:00,Science & Technology,"I want to present to you
the Bridgetown Initiative. It’s a pragmatic, ambitious plan
to save the world that's been gaining surprising traction. I’m going to start with a “who,”
move to the “what” and “where” we are. I came late to climate. I wasn't a skeptic. I'm an economist. We believe that if we don't value
something well enough, we tend to overconsume it. I believe that. I just wasn't seized by a compulsion
to do something about it myself until September 18, 2017. I was sitting in the 
departure lounge of JFK, waiting to go home
to Bridgetown, Barbados, nursing a coffee, and my phone buzzes. And it's Mia Amor Mottley, college friend and then-leader
of the opposition of Barbados. “Go to Dominica now,” she says.
Our neighboring island. ""They've just been smashed
by Hurricane Maria. They need all the help they can get. Time for you to step into the shoes
of that previous generation of influential development economists. Just like your dad."" She's compassionate, super smart, and obviously a good politician because I am on a UN
relief plane the next day, doing a hairpin turn to land
on the emergency airstrip in Dominica. The pilot's last mission
was dodging missiles in Syria, so I'm feeling fairly safe. I have my head wedged against the window
transfixed of what's below. A hurricane can release the energy
of 10,000 nuclear bombs. And below me is a nuclear wasteland. Pointing up towards me
are a million thin white sticks. Takes me a moment to realize they’re trees
stripped bare of all branches, leaves and bark. When we land, I’m assaulted by the smell
of burning and decomposition. And something else it takes me
a while longer to work out. I'm on a tropical island, normally teeming with birds
and insects and color, in deathly, monochrome silence. The birds have gone. The land is emptied. Later, Dominica's Prime Minister
Roosevelt Skerrit says, ""Dominicans have lost
everything money can buy in four hours."" The government's job was
to make them feel that what was left was the valuable stuff -- community, family, hope --
and to help them repair. Because if despair set in, then a bad, bad situation would get worse. Early on I work out that the way
to get recovery funds flowing is to make Dominica matter to the world. So Dominica declares they will rebuild as the world's first
climate-resilient nation. They dust themselves off,
stand tall and resolute, and invite the world's experts in. Turns out, the Dominicans
have the real insights. We made a list of all
the things they had to do in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and asked what would they have to do now so they wouldn't have to do that
next time around. And the answers kept on heading higher. Energy and health resilient systems. National and regional food security and then the global, because there's no real alternative
to halting climate change. And that's why the world's biggest plan,
the Bridgetown Initiative, comes partly from the world's
smallest countries. And it actually makes
even more sense to that, because tropical places
are where temperatures, droughts and sea levels will rise
to their highest, most extreme levels. We are the canaries in the mine and we can see there's no point
gasping for air for ourselves. We have to save the mine. And we can also see
what’s getting in the way, because whilst most people believe
climate change is here and happening and urgent, they also believe someone else
should be doing more about it. Rich countries are electrifying,
shifting, reducing, so much so that the majority
of greenhouse gas emissions, 63 percent and climbing, are now coming from developing countries. There is now no pathway to avoid the world's destabilizing
planetary systems without the green transformation
of developing countries. The rich say to the poor, ""You need to ban emissions, tax carbon, shift into renewables
and get with the program."" But that would slow the growth
of developing countries. They'd have to borrow a lot
at very high interest rates to invest in the new,
decommission the old, find new jobs for old
coal miners and more. And why should they? The rich cause global warming. They're responsible for 70 percent of the stock of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere for using up 60 percent
of the world's carbon budget. You can't scoff 60 percent of the cake
and then say afterwards, ""Well, we all need to cut back now."" (Laughter) Don't cement inequality. (Applause) ""Don't cement inequality,""
the poor say, ""Send aid."" The problem is that all
of the aid in the world will not fund one twelfth
of the green transformation in developing countries. And rich-country governments
are not getting elected to send money to foreigners. They're getting elected
to deport foreigners. So we're stuck, staring at each other, pointing fingers whilst the world burns. I figured that the way
to break this impasse is if we stop only looking at ourselves and make the cost of resilience so cheap, the flow of finance
after a disaster so immediate, the green transformation
of developing countries so profitable, that we turn reluctance into a scramble. There's no extra time. We're on countdown. And that is the essence
of the Bridgetown Initiative. During COVID and the global
financial crisis, rich countries purchased
24 trillion dollars of bonds to pump their economy. If instead, they'd purchased
24 trillion dollars of bonds that finance renewable energies, we would have had the same economic impact and be halfway to halting
climate change already. And we would have reduced
our inflationary dependence on oil and coal, all within 12 years. The power of what we can do
when it matters to us is unlimited. So here's the financing plan that does not rely on the altruism
of financiers and insurers, is not based on some unproven tech and does not skirt around our common
but different responsibilities. Picture three buckets. Small, medium and large. The smallest is actually
the hardest to fund. It's all of those things that don't
generate any savings or profits. It's rebuilding the homes
of low-income families that are being washed away
by climate events. It's rebuilding, recovering
their livelihoods, their clinics, their schools. And climate change, remember, is the increasing certainty
of rising losses. It's uninsurable. So we need new sources of public finance. We need new emission taxes
on oil and coal and methane. At the Mottley-Macron Summit
in June in Paris, we made some progress towards taxing
emissions on the shipping industry. We need more. And we need a small
financial transaction tax, like the one you don't even realize
you're paying today, that covers the cost of the US SEC. And energy and finance consumption
is slanted to the rich. The second bucket is for those things
that don't generate revenues but generate immediate savings. If I invest a dollar of borrowed
money on stronger seawalls, more muscular flood defenses,
more resilient health systems, I save several dollars. So we need the international
multilateral development banks, like the World Bank, to lend three times more
on the Sustainable Development Goals and to make that debt cheap
by making it longer and lower-cost. They can get halfway there by using the resources they already have. They're very conservative. And the other half, they need rich countries to put in
a little bit more capital. Now, some people criticize me for saying, why are you going for cheap
loans rather than grants? And I say, if you found a trillion dollars
stuffed behind the sofa, then OK. But grants will never be enough. And so let's focus our grants
on those things that can't be funded any other way because there's no savings and profits. The final bucket, the biggest bucket, is for those things
for which there is a revenue attached. But before I go to that,
on the second bucket at Paris, at the Motley-Macron Summit, we got a commitment of an extra
20 billion dollars of lending a year, a start. The third bucket, the biggest, revenue. Solar farms, wind turbines, they make money whilst
reducing greenhouse gases. In the rich countries, 81 percent of that is funded
by the private sector. If we want developing countries
to move faster than rich countries do, then we want those investors
to go to the developing world. They don't today because of the high cost
of guaranteeing their returns against the fluctuation of currencies. However, history shows that an international agency
capitalized by rich countries that takes a diversified view
across time and countries can lower the cost
without losing money ... by enough to unblock
the flow of investments. And a small group of countries have agreed
to move on a pilot this year. Three buckets: small one for costs, middle one for savings, big one for revenues. There are a couple of things we also need
to do that doesn't cost money. We need Barbados-style pause clauses
in all debt instruments. When a disaster hits, you suspend -- your interest payments and debt repayments
are suspended for two years, added back on to later
when you can afford it. It will release billions of dollars
and reshape the financial system. And as Prime Minister Mottley says, if we want these institutions
that were set up in the colonial era, if we want to trust them
to save the world, then the people they serve
cannot be invisible in the halls of power. (Applause) So the impasse is cracking. I got on that plane to Dominica
because of my dad. Not because of his profession,
but because he was a dad. I remember asking him once, when I was being asked
to join an unpopular cause that was going to hurt my career, and I was half hoping he would say,
""No, son, that's silly."" Instead, he said gently, ""Avi, you've got to be
a player in this life."" So here I am. Please join us. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #Wikipedia","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'media', 'collaboration', 'education', 'exploration', 'humanity', 'TEDx', 'Internet', 'Annie Rauwerda']",2023-10-19T07:12:25-07:00,2023-10-19T07:12:25-07:00,Science & Technology,"When I was younger, I used to be really into Trivial Pursuit and sometimes I would memorize
the backs of the cards so I could win. And that's how I learned
some of my favorite trivia. Like, there's a name for those
three asterisks in the book when the vibe changes. It's called a dinkus. And I also learned that Oklahoma
has a state vegetable and it's a watermelon. I've always really liked trivia precisely because it's information
that carries no responsibility at all. If you forget the information
that's going to be on your test or your mom's birthday,
you might have consequences, but you never have a test
on state vegetables. It's learning that's just for fun. I've always been pretty curious. I graduated in 2022 and my favorite parts
of my neuroscience classes were not necessarily
the nitty gritty physiology. I really liked the funnier stuff, like the protein in limb development
named after Sonic the hedgehog, or this bridged bicyclic molecule that looks like a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle. Not all of my coursework was so charming, but I tried to convince myself that everything was at least
a little bit interesting. One of the best ways
to make things more interesting is to learn more than you have to. My favorite place for a long time,
to quench my curiosity is Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia
that anyone can edit. I've been a longtime fan. I journaled about my Wikipedia
reading habits when I was in fifth grade. And when classes went online in 2020, I found myself scrolling
through all these Wikipedia articles and contributing. Anyone can edit the site. Some of the things I read
had to do with my coursework. Like, I learned that the p in pH
doesn't stand for anything. OK. I also learned about things
that had no relation to my classes -- Fictional worms, non-water floods. Before I could think too long
about what it would have been like to live in London when beer
was flowing through the streets, I was reading about Goblu
and Beatosu, fake towns. They don't exist, but they were put
on the official Michigan map in the Ohio section at the bottom by mischievous mapmakers in the '70s. (Laughter) I started screenshotting my favorite
pieces of trivia on Wikipedia and I put them on Instagram. And that was in the early pandemic
and I'm still doing it. I posted things like
the Michigan State professor who took this model kidney to Disney World to see if roller coasters
help pass kidney stones. They do. (Laughter) Good to know. Wikipedia is created by real people. Unlike traditional publishers
or other encyclopedias, it doesn't require
that you're an expert in your field. This is a user whose name is Diannaa, who has written probably everything
you know about World War II. And also P Diddy. There are thousands of people like this. You don't have to be an expert. You just have to be able
to synthesize sources and follow style guidelines. Those guidelines are strict, but not so strict
that a little personality doesn't shine through sometimes. This article about the Popemobile I think has quite a bit of personality. It says ""John Paul II requested that the media stop referring
to the car as the popemobile, saying that the term was ‘undignified.’ The popemobile ... ” and then it goes on and on. (Laughter) I'm also a fan of the Wikipedia editor who saw this caption
about a bagpiper and a penguin and decided to clarify
which was the bagpiper. (Laughter) Thank you, very helpful. I'm a fan of the Wikipedia editor
that submitted this photo for Vienna bread that has motion blur for some reason. (Laughter) Wikipedia sometimes feels infinite. And I'm sure you've heard warnings
that it's not perfect. Maybe your seventh grade teacher said,
""Don't use Wikipedia, anyone can edit it."" And it's true that there is some
misinformation and disinformation on the site. Often, it's only up
for a few seconds or minutes, but sometimes hoaxes last longer. For example, there was an article for 10 years about an Aboriginal god
called Jar'Edo Wens. It didn't cite any sources. It should have been deleted,
but it wasn't. And eventually, this information
was printed in books and told in university lectures. Until after 10 years, somebody realized
that the article was just created by probably an Australian teenager
named Jared Owens. (Laughter) So Wikipedia is not perfect, but studies have shown that it contains
fewer factual inaccuracies than Encyclopedia Britannica. And I think that's really impressive. When I was in the -- In the summer of 2020,
I kept posting my favorite trivia. Physically, I was quarantined,
but I was exploring the world. Things like breast-shape hills
or this unusual chess opening. I definitely was aware
that there were islands in lakes. Like, I knew that was a thing. But it had never occurred to me that there could be an island
in a lake on an island. I also had never thought
about the possibility of an island in a lake
on an island in a lake. And I had definitely
never considered the idea of an island in a lake on an island
in a lake on an island. (Laughter) Wikipedia is just huge. It has 6.6 million articles
in English alone. But it's not done. Wikipedia needs editors like you
to contribute to free knowledge, whether that's small things
like fixing commas or adding sources or big things like heavy content editing or making sure people aren't using it
for advertisements. There are some fun ways to contribute. This is a website called
wikishootme.toolforge.org and it shows you what landmarks
nearby need photos. That's a fun way to contribute. Wikipedia should be representative
of everything in the world and you would hope that its contributors
also reflected the world's population. By best estimates, the contributors
are about 80 percent male, so there are a lot of efforts
with edit-a-thons and marketing campaigns
to get more people editing. I'll remind you, it's created
by very normal, real people. This couple in 2008 noticed that there were no photos
on the Wikipedia article for high five, so they took matters in their own hands, acting out the sequence: up high, down low, victim misses,
and too slow with finger guns. And then they added a hyperlink so you can go visit
the finger gun article if you want to. I thought this was very charming
when I first saw it. And so I reached out to them,
I tracked them down. It turns out after this,
after they did this, they started dating, they got married, they had kids, and they agreed to recreate
the photos with their kids. (Laughter and applause) So I ... People take the task of writing
an encyclopedia very seriously. I said that I get really into trivia. Some of these people will spend
a long time doing very trivial things. There was a long debate on whether
the caption ""Guy Standing sitting"" was too funny for an encyclopedia. They eventually removed the caption. There was a 40,000-word discussion
on whether to capitalize the I in “Star Trek Into Darkness.” There was an even longer discussion on whether this thing
should be called corn or maize. Maize is winning, as Ann Arbor
will be happy to know. So ultimately, I kind of laugh
at this sort of meticulous detail, but I'm glad that people are thinking
this deeply about things, especially in an era
of social media filter bubbles and 24-hour news cycles, when truth looks different
depending on where you look. People on Wikipedia are coming together
to write history in real time. I think the inner workings of an online
encyclopedia are fascinating. Turns out, other people do too. When I was a student here last year, I started moonlighting as a journalist, explaining how a site this big
gets made by volunteers. I wrote about how,
when after Russia invaded Ukraine, downloads of Wikipedia
skyrocketed in Russia as the state was limiting free press. Wikipedia is not perfect, but clearly it's an information source
that people desire. Or when the Queen died,
I wrote about the Wikipedia editor that was so quick to change
her article into past tense. (Laughter) I kept posting online
and I was getting a following and I started leading edit-a-thons
to get more people to contribute. Then I started doing comedy shows and I was surprised to learn that one, I thought it was fun, but also people were excited to pay money
to go to a show about an encyclopedia. I'm still really drawn
to useless knowledge. Like Diego, the tortoise
who had so much sex that he saved his species. (Laughter) (Applause) Some applause for him, great. I'll let him know. (Applause) Or I like ""Boops boops in a bucket,"" I just like that. But I really wouldn't call it
useless knowledge. I don't think I would call anything
useless knowledge, because the thing about trivia is that it's an invitation
to learn more about a subject. You might learn a trivia fact
and suddenly you're far more interested and you're learning about things you never thought were interesting before. Ken Jennings once said trivia
was the bait on the fishhook of education. I previously had little interest
in the romantic period of piano music, and then I learned that Franz Liszt, he had such good looks
and dramatic performances that these girls
in the 1800s in Europe were getting diagnosed
with something called Liszt fever because they were such fan girls. Suddenly, I'm interested
in piano music history. Similarly, I didn't have a lot of interest
in life in the 13th century. And then I learned
about this boy named Onfim and he was a six-year-old and his random birch bark
drawings were preserved. And he wrote things that you would
see a six-year-old draw today, like these proclamations like,
""I am a wild beast."" And his stick figure drawings
with too many fingers, they look like something
that a six-year-old would draw today. It reminded me that for all of history,
people have always been people. Sometimes with trivia,
you start somewhere random and then you start thinking about empathy and geopolitics and who knows,
science, what have you. Facts are really powerful,
even fun facts. And luckily, we live at a time where information has never been
easier to access. Whether you're looking for fictional worms or non-water floods or more serious things
like atmospheric carbon data. If nothing else, trivia reminds you that the world is huge and it's amazing and it's really interesting and I don't think that's trivial at all."

a single piece of artwork generated by artificial intelligence. When most of us think of AI art, I bet we're imagining something like this. We're all probably picturing
something totally different. Today, with machine learning models like
DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, we've seen AI produce everything
from strange life forms to imaginary influencers to entirely foreign,
curious kinds of imagery. AI as a technology is fascinating to us because we're inherently drawn
to things we cannot understand. And with neural networks processing data
from thousands of other images made by people from every possible
generation, every art movement, millions of images in one simple scan, they can produce visuals
that are so familiar yet strikingly unfamiliar. More poetically, AI mirrors us. The world is beginning to change
right before our very eyes, and it's basically divided
into two schools of thought. There are pessimists who think AI poses
a great threat to human creativity. And then optimists who see it
as an extension of our creativity. So is it even possible to be truly
original as an artist anymore? How do we begin to critically engage
with artworks made by machines? We can start by looking at some metaphors, narratives and insights from artists who are truly pushing
the boundaries of AI. Let's look to these moments
of delight, surprise, confusion and wonder that give us just one small glimpse into the possibilities of encounter
with this technology. Because as we've seen, this is a very moral and ethical encounter as much as an aesthetic one. Mario Klingemann sold this piece
on auction in 2019. It is running an AI model
trained on thousands of portraits from the 17th to 19th centuries. The model constantly reveals uncanny
interpretations of the human face. Each one is unique, generated in real time
as the machine reads its own output. For the viewer, it's almost like peering
into the machine's hallucinations as it conjures each new portrait. Sofia Crespo's series ""Neural Zoo""
uses neural network interpretations of the real world to generate unreal sea creatures
and diverse biological forms. Frogs look like flowers. Translucent jellyfish
have vivid internal organs. There’s no one real creature
in these images, but AI allows us to envision otherworldly
lifeforms in impossible detail. This abstract piece by Sara Ludy
began as a digital painting. It was augmented to fit a 16-by-9 ratio, using a prompt for ""torn edges""
in DALL-E 2's Outpainting. Outpainting allows artists
to extend their creativity beyond the frame using simple
language prompts like ""torn edges."" This piece by Ivona Tau
might read as a photograph, but it is also the work of AI. It's the result of GAN training
on thousands of images from the artist's personal
photo collection. Tau curates from her own photographs, carefully choosing the inputs
and outputs for the model. In many ways, AI art
is a form of curation. It becomes the process of selecting
from hundreds of images at a time. This video pulls from models trained
on a massive data set of Tau's photos, resulting in a kind of algorithmic memory. But she also created a destructed
data set for the model to symbolize forgetting
or fleeting memory. And finally, we have Claire Silver. Silver has called herself
a “collaborative AI artist” in that she works intentionally
with the machine to produce her art. Her process is constantly evolving
as the tools evolve. She often works
with inpainting techniques, masking and transforming
just one small piece of an image. For this portrait, she shifted the opacity
of various sections with an Apple pencil, transforming it bit by bit. She likens this technique to her version
of glazing in oil painting. Silver feeds AI-generated images
from one model into another, effectively creating new forms
of language and understanding for the machine itself. Her work is half master painting,
half digital art. Both old and new. This piece pulls inspiration
from famed artists like John Singer Sargent,
Evelyn De Morgan and Gustav Klimt, almost as an homage. Because different AI models are trained
on different sets of information, it's almost like they're all speaking
different languages. AI is everywhere now. We are all now collectively
co-creating with AI, whether we're aware of it or not. If we want to be a part of these worlds,
we cannot design alone. If we want to be culturally literate in these new kinds of images
and predictions and forms, then looking to the work of artists
is a very productive place to start. We need to brace ourselves
for an increasingly technological future, which is only going to multiply all the creative possibilities
at our fingertips now. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #poetry","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'business', 'economics', 'history', 'poetry', 'humanity', 'David McWilliams']",2023-11-01T09:38:24-07:00,2023-11-01T09:38:24-07:00,People & Blogs,"I was supposed to go
in the very first session. And I had a plan. And that plan was I'd do TED,
I'd see Vancouver, I'd chill out, I'd get this thing done, then I’d relax. I'd listen to other people's speeches,
rob their best ideas, bring them home and sound
incredibly, incredibly brainy. And then your man, Chris,
rings me last weekend. He says, ""You know
that last thing, the first thing? Why don't you go last?"" I'm like, ""Oh, man."" That brought to mind the words
of the great American philosopher, Mike Tyson. (Laughter) Who said of plans, ""Everybody has a plan
until they get a punch in the face."" (Laughter) And of course, you know,
doing the last gig at TED, it's not about the pressure,
that's not the problem. The pressure isn't the problem. The problem is the sobriety. (Laughter) But the speeches have been amazing, right? And if I could kind of
encapsulate them all, it's really been about,
as far as I can see, the pace of change and what that's doing
to us demographically, politically, socially, economically. Extraordinary stuff. And I'd now like to quote from a great liberal, democrat, a friend of TED, Vladimir Lenin. (Laughter) Who said of change and crises that there are decades
when nothing happens and there are weeks when decades happen. And we’re living through those weeks,
you get that feeling, and it’s really difficult to know
where to start to think about these ... How do you analyze this stuff? Now, if I was an American economist or a Canadian economist or, God forbid, an English economist -- Actually the nice thing is
they're not good at economics anymore. It's so beautiful, isn't it? (Laughter) Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. (Laughter) But I'd come here armed
with the tools of my trade. You know, the graphs and the charts
and the maths and all that good stuff. But I'm an Irish economist, so I'm only going to come here armed with some lines and some verses of poetry. (Laughter) Yeah. (Applause) Thank you very much,
the poets in the corner. We're a small minority. (Laughter) But perfectly formed. Now, I want to talk to you about a poem
that was written in 1919 called ""The Second Coming""
by W.B. Yeats, our national poet. And the fascinating thing about crisis, so in 1919, 100-odd years ago -- the fascinating thing about crisis
is that every generation feels that their crisis is the big one. We're kind of narcissistic
about it, right? But every generation experiences crisis. Every generation, our parents,
our grandparents, they all did. How we deal with the crisis is the definitive issue
for our generation. So Yates is sitting in Dublin, 1919. He's trying to make sense
of the world, right? His world is changing rapidly. The German Empire is over. The Austrian Empire is over. The Ottoman Empire is over. Ireland has declared a war
of independence against Britain, which, if you were a betting man, you wouldn't really give us, not our side, you wouldn't
have given us good odds. And Yeats is trying to figure out
not just what is happening, but what is likely to happen. And he writes these words,
and just listen to them and imagine they were written now. “The Second Coming.” “Turning and turning 
in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; 
the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed on the world, / A blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere / The procession of innocence is drowned; / The best lack all conviction, the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.” Just let those words lie. “Things fall apart, the best people lack conviction, the worst are full
of passionate intensity.” Now, this is Yeats writing 100 years ago, and the historical rhythm and repetition
is clear, I think, to all of us. But what really interests me
as an economist is the contrast between
what Yeats, the poet, was saying back then and what all the economists, the people who were employed to think
about the future, were saying. So, Yeats said, ""The center will not hold."" Three years after he wrote this, three years, three to four years, Mussolini was in power in Italy, Stalin was on the ascendancy
in the Soviet Union and a little, small, unprepossessing man
with a mustache called Adolf Hitler had just orchestrated a putsch in Munich. Yates was right. Yates was right. And what were all the economists
saying back then? The people who were paid
to think about the future? They were all saying, ""Oh, don't worry,
we'll go back to the gold --"" Not all, the vast majority -- ""We will go back to the gold standard. We'll trade again. Germany will pay all its reparations and the First World War will have been
the war to end all wars."" How wrong could they be? So what's always bugged me is why did the poet get things
so right at a tipping point, and the economists get things so wrong? And I believe it is because the poet,
the artist, the musician, these types of people give themselves,
at a tipping point, the permission to think unconventionally. They see the world differently. Do we value the unconventional thinker? Do we? And maybe the best way
to answer that question is to go all the way back to school, to the place we begin to learn. Now just bring yourselves back
to your school days. Remember yourself at 13. Just remember the person you were. I remember the classroom. I remember the teachers,
I remember the building, I remember the break,
I remember everything. I remember the sports day,
I remember the whole thing. In fact, there's a gang of five of us
who've hung around since we were in school. And those five lads I was in school with spent the entire of our school years
looking out the window They just didn't get it. They just didn't get school at all. And they've gone on to have
incredibly successful lives in their own individual ways. But their intelligence, their form of intelligence,
was not recognized. And as we get older, we realize the world is full
of various different intelligences. But back in school, we only really recognized
one type of intelligence. And that was like the little kid who could
come in -- big, wide-eyed kid, right? -- he’d come in, could absorb all this
information into his head or her head, opened some sort of weird compartment, stuff it all in, stuff,
stuff, stuff it all in. And then, in early June, when the weather gets good in Ireland -- and I presume it’s the same
all over the place except for Vancouver -- write like bejesus, right? That was the type
of intelligence we rewarded. It's like getting a prize for being
a walking filing cabinet, right? (Laughter) That's one intelligence. It is an intelligence,
but it's only one type of intelligence. And what about all
the other kids over here, the kids who didn’t get it? ... They weren't not only recognized, their intelligence was besmirched, humiliated and belittled. My daughter is dyslexic. She hated every single day of school. And as a result of this system, we have a strange thing in our society where there are thousands
of incredibly clever people who left school feeling stupid. But the corollary is also the case. There are many
actually quite stupid people -- (Laughter) You know where I'm going -- Who left school feeling very, very clever. And those kids, when they
were really good kids, they used to get the best marks in school. In Ireland, we have
a little star over the right. And of course, the teacher
told them they were clever, and the priests, the nuns, and of course, their mummy
told them they were clever, right? If you want to get a sense
of an Irish mummy, an Irish mummy is the sort of mother that makes an American
soccer mom look unambitious. (Laughter) I know, I have one, right? I am the son of a retired schoolteacher. If anybody else in the room is the son
or daughter of a schoolteacher, we can form a self-help group later on
to deal with our trauma, right? But those sort of kids, they do extremely,
extremely well in school, then they do very, very well in college. And then they get on,
because they do very, well, on to the graduate trainee programs
and they join the big banks, and they join the big firms
and they join insurance companies, they join the consultancies,
and they're on the fast track. They’re on the fast track career-wise. And something weird happens
as their career progresses. We like to think
that we surround ourselves with people who think differently, but we don't. There's something
called confirmation bias. We actually surround ourselves
with people who confirm our biases. And how this works
in institutions is the following. We end up employing people
who think like us, right? And like, if you imagine
an interview process, so the person goes into the interview
and there's two clever persons saying, ""No, no, you're clever.""
""You're clever, you're amazing."" ""You've got that grade.""
""You went to that university."" ""I read that paper you wrote.""
""You're clever, clever, amazing."" ""Feck it, just have the job."" So the interview becomes -- By the way, I said “feck” there. Not the other word. Feck is a sort of a linguistic
version of a white lie. OK? It's used at home. Now, what actually happens is the interview process
just becomes like a Tinder for people who can do algebra. OK. (Laughter) So they all go into the institution and then what you get, you get groupthink because everyone's thinking the same way. And of course, because these people have always been
the clever kids with the right answer, they defined themselves,
""I'm the person with the right answer."" And what happens when you’re the person
who always has the right answer? It’s very hard to be wrong. So it breeds a sort of an overconfidence. And we know that overconfidence and overconfident people can really overestimate
their competence's critical moments. The thing comes from a thing
called Dunning-Kruger in psychology. It's a great story. A fella goes in to rob a bank in America. Somewhere, I think Pittsburgh,
down there somewhere. In the '90s, a lad goes
into rob a bank, OK? He runs into the bank ...
he’s got no mask, no balaclava, no nothing, right? The security camera looks at him. And he winks at it. He winks again, big smile,
""Hi, how are you?"" He goes in, holds up the bank,
robs the thing. Goes off. Coppers, come in, look at the securities. ""See this geezer,
just waved to the camera. Does anyone know him?"" ""Oh, yeah, he lives around the corner,
around the second block, sixth house, up third floor."" So they arrive and bang on the door, the man's there, I presume,
kind of eating a takeaway or something. And copper said, ""We want
to bang you off for the bank robbery."" And he said, ""How do you mean,
the bank robbery?"" “We’ve got you on camera
for the bank robbery ... here we go.” ""How do you mean?""
""We've got you!"" “How could you possibly know?
I wore the juice!” Copper looks at him, says, “What?” Do you remember when we were kids? Invisible ink? And you put lemon juice
on the invisible ink -- this is a true story -- and you disappear. Your man covered his face with lemon juice and he thought he was invisible. The overconfident
overestimating their competence. Now, when the psychologists
thought about this, they actually did lots and lots of tests. And apparently it's true,
that this is a thing in society. And surprise, surprise, the Dunning-Kruger effect
is much more prevalent in men than women. Who would have known? (Laughter) Shock horror. I can see it in my own family. Our son, for example, comes home,
teenager, after doing an exam. Hasn't done a tap of work, right? Comes in the door and everyone
in the family's in the kitchen saying, ""How did you do in your exam?"" And he says, ""Oh, Jesus,
I aced that, man, no problem."" And he fails all the time. (Laughter) All the time. So you see these things
and that again it happens. And of course, how this happens in institutions
is you get very overconfident people, very intelligent, can't make mistakes. And we saw that
in the 2008 financial crisis. 2008, the biggest financial crisis
the world has ever seen. And the vast majority of economists
and the Fed and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank
and Wall Street missed the whole thing. In fact, the Queen of England
went to the LSC about two or three months
after the crash and she said, ""If you chaps were so clever, how come none of you saw this coming?"" (Laughter) And she was right. (Laughter) Because they all were wearing the juice. (Laughter) The economics juice. Now, JK Galbraith,
very famous Canadian economist. But Galbraith said something fascinating
about the conventional person. He said, ""When faced with the choice
between changing his mind and finding the proof not to do so, the conventional man always gets busy
looking for the proof."" And that's when we make big mistakes
at these critical moments. Leonard Cohen, the Canadian poet, put it differently, the same idea. Cohen said, ""There is a crack in everything. And that is how the light gets in."" What Cohen was saying to us was, look for the cracks, look into the cracks. That's where we'll see the big picture. So let’s just leave the Canadian poet, go back to an Irish poet. The words of ""The Second Coming"" again, our world right now. “Turning and turning 
in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; 
the center cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed on the world, / A blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere, / The procession
of innocence is drowned.” And why, says Yeats? Because the best lack all conviction and the worst are full
of passionate intensity. Now apply that to our world. And if you, at this tipping point say, ""Nah, you know, it's not my problem, I lack all conviction."" Right? “I go and watch baseball,” or rounders or whatever that game is
you guys watch, right? But if you lack all conviction, what actually happens
is the worst people in our society, with their passionate intensity,
their certitude, their simple ideas, they will win the day
at this tipping point. And they will win the day
because the best people back away from the responsibility. And what Yates was also saying
about the best people was the following. He said, mandate the best. The poets, the artists, the musicians, because they are the people
who see the possibilities. They see the possibilities because they see the world
from a different angle. They have to be part of the solution. So my idea that I think is worth spreading
is the following. If you want to understand the world
a little bit more clearly, listen less to my tribe, the economists, and listen more
to Yeats's tribe, the poets. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you very much."

#TED #TEDTalks #wisdom","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'social change', 'humanity', 'personal growth', 'mindfulness', 'Krista Tippett']",2023-10-11T04:00:16-07:00,2023-10-11T04:00:16-07:00,People & Blogs,"Here is one way to begin
to talk about what the pandemic, the post-2020 world,
began to set in motion. All together, for a time, we felt for the ground beneath our feet. We remembered that the ground
beneath our feet is never as solid as we believe it to be. We remembered that civilization revolves around something so tender as bodies breathing
in proximity to other bodies. We softened. Chasms became un-unseeable. Between the ways we've been living
and our deepest longings for all of our children and the highest potentials
for human flourishing. So how to step into
what we have been given to see, how we have been given
to learn and to grow. I've been looking back across my 20 years
of listening to the world and being in a radio
and podcast conversation with wise and graceful lives. And I want to share with you
three arts of living that have persistently emerged. Callings. Each of them carries practices
towards what it might mean for each of us to participate as we move forward
in the remaking of this world. The first is to see the generative story, the generative narrative of our time. We are fluent in and very familiar with the narrative of catastrophe and dysfunction and disarray. And that is real. But it's not the whole story of us. There is also an abundant reality of things going right at any given time. Of learning and growth that are happening, of evolution and breakthrough. One of the things that happens
when I use this phrase, the generative narrative,
and people hear it for the first time is sometimes they'll say,
""Well, give me an example."" And I say, ""Just look around you."" Even when we leave this special place and go back to all the places
we came from, it is ordinary that all kinds of people
with all kinds of lives are finding ways to be of service. They are standing before a world in pain. They are working
with forms that are broken. They're probably working in institutions
that don't quite make sense anymore, and they're having an edifying effect
on the people around them, becoming healers and social creatives in so many forms. Now we are strange creatures, and this is one
of our strangest qualities. We don't know how to tell
this generative story of us as vividly. We don't know how to take it
as seriously as that story of rupture. And this has started to make sense as we are able to peer more intricately
inside our brains and bodies. It turns out that our brains
are exquisitely designed to keep us safe and on the alert for danger. Our brains are riveted by what goes wrong. They are looking in every instant
for what will go wrong next. And this underlying orientation turns up in our most sophisticated places, certainly in the field of journalism,
in which I trained. It turns out that we actually
have to more actively, consciously orient ourselves if we want to attend to and get riveted by what is good and redemptive. The invitation here
is to take in the good. And just naming, calling it out, that there is a generative
story of our time, that you can see it too, this is a way to begin. Take in the good. Let it start to actively shape
the whole picture of the world you are working with. And when you do that,
you begin to make the generative -- this whole landscape
of generative people and projects, more visible and defining
to themselves and to this world which carries so much pain
and so much promise. My second offering
is to live the questions. And this one is a gift
from the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, who became a friend
across time and space to me in years I spent
as a very young journalist in divided Cold War Berlin. In the early 20th century,
Rilke wrote a wonderful series of letters to a young poet in which he counseled, ""Be patient with all
that is unresolved in your heart."" He said, ""Try to love
the questions themselves as though they were locked rooms or books written
in a very foreign language."" He said, ""Don't try
to reach for the answers which could not be given to you now because you would not
be able to live them."" The point is to live everything. Live the questions now,
then, perhaps someday far in the future, you will gradually,
without even noticing it, live your way into the answers. Like us, Rilke was a citizen
of a young century with spectacular potentials
for creating and destroying. And it's come to seem to me that the great challenges, all of the great challenges
before our young century on some level are vast,
aching open questions. All of our challenges,
ecological, racial, economic, spiritual, political -- vast, aching, open questions for which we will not have
anything like answers any time soon. So I find myself
returned anew to this wisdom that when we find ourselves
in this situation, we are called to honor and dwell
with the questions themselves. Now we live in a culture
that is in love with the form of words that is an answer, an opinion. And we are in love with the way with words that is an argument. But a question is a mighty form of words. As an interviewer, I know that questions
elicit answers in their likeness. Answers rise or fall
to the questions they meet. And it is a deep, deep truth
in science as in life that at any given moment
we are being shaped as much by the questions we're carrying as by the answers
we have it in us to give. Those moments when
a new question rises up in us, stops us in our tracks, those are pivot points. Those are moments when
the possibility of discovery breaks in. So the invitation here
is to engage the adventure of a new reverence
for the questions that are alive in you, the questions that are alive
in the world around you. That question, which I believe
almost every one of us standing before our world
and its pain and its problems, wondering, ""How can I possibly make a difference? How to begin?"" Spend some time formulating
your variation on that question. Write it down. Commit to having it
over your shoulder, in your ear as you move through
the next few months of your life. See what it invites you to see and to move towards and to move away from. I have found that if you are faithful
to living a question, that question will be
faithful back to you. And my third offering
is about calling and wholeness. The Latin word for “calling,” “vocare,” is the root of our word
in English, ""vocation."" And in the world in which I was born, vocation was very narrowly equated
with work and job title. But we are not called
merely to be professional people. We are called to be friends, neighbors, family, citizens. Lovers of the world. And just as there are callings for a life, there are callings for our time. It has come to seem to me
that our generation in time, our generation of our species, is called to nothing less than wholeness, that we have it in us to figure out what it would mean
to cultivate whole human beings with whole institutions, living in whole societies. The invitation here is to turn your powerful
reality-shifting imagination, your intelligence, your energy, your will towards the possibility of wholeness. How to live into that. And I want to be very clear that becoming whole has nothing to do
with aspiring to perfection. It is not about achieving perfection, and becoming whole also does not mean that we become less strange
or wild or complicated. Becoming whole would mean
that we orient together away from what is death-dealing and towards what is life-giving. Every fracture of our world
notwithstanding, the science of our age
is revealing all of life in its insistence on wholeness, the interplay between our bodies,
the natural world, the lives we make, the worlds we create. And every dilemma around
our technologies notwithstanding, our technologies have given us, for the first time
in the history of our species, the tools to think and act as a species. Take that in. It is the calling of callings to make that more vivid
and tangible and real, each of us starting inside ourselves
and with the lives we've been given. And across my life of conversation, I have learned that wisdom and wholeness emerge in moments precisely like ours, though ours is writ large, where human beings have to hold
seemingly opposing realities in a creative tension and interplay, power and frailty, birth and death, pain and hope, mystery and conviction, brokenness and beauty, calm and fierceness, mine and yours. Let's begin. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #work","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'business', 'creativity', 'work', 'society', 'work-life balance', 'The Way We Work', 'Alex Soojung-Kim Pang']",2023-10-17T13:32:34-07:00,2023-10-17T13:32:34-07:00,People & Blogs,"The world teaches us that long hours
are inevitable and inescapable, that overwork is a badge of honor
and resting is a weakness. Super successful people rise and grind,
are always on and never stop. Deep down, we know this is unhealthy
and unsustainable. But is there an alternative? [The Way We Work] Downtime is deeply undervalued
in today's 24/7 world, but it hasn't always been this way. Virtually every ancient society defined the good life
as balancing work and rest, and recent research
in neuroscience and psychology has shown that rest
strengthens our brains, enhances our learning
and stimulates our creativity. History's most accomplished scientists, writers and military leaders worked
far fewer hours than we do today and built daily routines full of downtime. People like naturalist Charles Darwin
and geneticist Barbara McClintock, who both took daily walks, knew that work and rest are not opposites, they are partners. You won't fully flourish
until you can master both. Here's where you can start. First, rethink what rest is. Getting enough sleep at night is key, and 20-minute naps
are wonderful for a boost. But when it comes to taking
downtime in the day, the most restorative rest isn't found
on a couch or in front of a screen. The best rest is active: exercise, hobbies, walks. These recharge our mental
and physical batteries more effectively and give us more stamina and resilience
than being a couch potato. Rest is natural, but it's also a skill. It's something we can practice
and improve over time. Just as athletes, singers
and Buddhist monks use breathing to run faster, project their voices
and calm their minds, we can use rest to boost
our creativity and recovery. Second, integrate it into your daily work. Athletes get the best results
combining intensive training and recovery. Likewise, creative people should layer
periods of distraction-free, deep work with periods of deliberate rest. So design a routine
that lets you focus and get into flow for four or five hours a day, every day. Make those periods
more intensive, not longer, by killing distractions. Give yourself permission to turn off
email and messages and concentrate on what matters. And then, if you have the flexibility, give yourself a nice, long, active break. It will give your creative subconscious
a chance to work on unsolved problems while you recover and generate those insights
and aha moments that turn good ideas into breakthroughs. And if you don't have that flexibility, find a way to make sure
that when you're off from work that you apply these same principles
to at least part of your downtime. Third, tap into deep play. Creative, passionate people
need breaks from their work, but those breaks have to be
just as compelling as their work or they won't take them. Many scientists and CEOs
are amateur painters, musicians or chefs on the side. These are hobbies that provide
the same sense of accomplishment, control, mastery and flow
that they get when work goes really well, but in a different environment
and with a clear, quick reward. Often, their interests
date from childhood, which makes them even more meaningful. So embrace an activity that makes you feel
alive and involved in the world. It's not a distraction. It'll give you new experiences
and the same pleasures and rewards as work at its best, Without the compromises or ambiguities
that often cloud things. Fourth, make rest social. The working world isn't designed for rest. We have to take it. And one of the most powerful ways
to guarantee that we make time for rest is to do it with others. So start work early and meet a colleague
for a walk in the afternoon. Or team up with your partner
to perform a tea ceremony. Or make a childcare-swapping
arrangement with a friend to give you both more time for rest. Remember, it's not easy for busy,
highly driven people to rest. It requires developing new practices
and giving them time to become habits. You can't rush it. Just as it takes time
to settle into a new job or home, your mind needs time to start
harnessing the power of rest. Don't beat yourself up if you aren't
already doing anything like this. There's no better time to start than now."

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'education', 'future', 'work', 'personal growth', 'The Way We Work', 'Michelle R. Weise']",2023-09-26T13:00:18-07:00,2023-09-26T13:00:18-07:00,Science & Technology,"How many jobs have you had? How many do you expect to have
over the course of your career? Well, the scary thing is that number
has historically been around 12. But in the future, I predict it'll be closer
to 20 or 30 or more. And a lot of those jobs
don't even exist yet. This future of work sounds overwhelming, especially when you take into account
our old-fashioned system of resumes, job postings and applicant
tracking systems. It's hard enough to navigate
just a single career transition, but you're far more
prepared than you think to navigate your next job change and all the ones that come after. [The Way We Work] I’m Dr. Michelle Weise, and I advise companies
and educational institutions on how to prepare workers
for successful and longer careers. Right now, I want to talk about how you
can navigate that longer career, starting with your next job change. Number one, highlight your human skills. When we talk about skills, we tend to focus on hard skills
like coding, editing, data visualization or budgeting. But human skills need to share
the spotlight, too. These are skills like adaptability,
collaboration, exercising judgment or mediating tense situations. They may not always show up
in obvious ways on your resume, but they have enormous value. To surface your human skills, make a timeline of all
of your experiences, both personal and professional. Do you see patterns? Have certain skills grown over time? Maybe your stint as a barista
made you a great team player or good at communicating in chaos. Or maybe your experience
as a caregiver for a child or someone with special needs gave you strengths
like patience or empathy, which informs how you design
human-centered digital products or guide teams through a reorganization. Human skills are deeply transferable. You might surprise yourself
by how prepared you already are for your next role. Second, become a skills translator. You need to translate your skills into the language
of your prospective employer. Research the industry
you want to move into because the same skill
can have vastly different meanings depending on the context. For instance, when a marketing position
is asking for a candidate who's strong in communication, they're usually looking for you to display
storytelling or branding skills. But when a behavioral health position
mentions communication, it's likely the employer is looking
for your experience with counseling or crisis management. Become their translator. Third, find data in discomfort. At work, when do you feel uncomfortable? Maybe you feel out of depth
when people bring up a new technology or a platform, or maybe someone
at your current organization got the raise or promotion
that you wanted? Pay attention to those signals. That kind of discomfort is good. It's data telling you
where you need to level up. Sign up for a course to get up to speed
on that new platform or application. Transform that discomfort
around your skills gaps into action. Finally, get picky. You shouldn't be the only one
committed to your skill development. Your employer should be too. The next time you change jobs, try to choose a company or organization
that is building talent from within. Look at LinkedIn and see if people
have risen within the company. Ask during the interview
whether there are clear road maps for internal advancement. The reality is, most companies
have so much work to do when it comes to recognizing human skills, spotting talent in unexpected places and cultivating the careers
of their own employees. You want an employer that takes
the long view on your career and can help you fill
your skills gaps on the job. Even if the job market
can feel broken at times, remember, you can take control,
you can steer the process, you can surface your hidden skills, translate your strengths
and level up your gaps. You can show employers new ways to think
about why they should hire you. And when you do, all of those lane changes ahead
will feel a whole lot less intimidating and maybe even a little exciting."

#TED #TEDTalks #business","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'business', 'communication', 'work', 'TEDx', 'Bob Wiltfong']",2023-09-08T07:50:08-07:00,2023-09-08T07:50:08-07:00,People & Blogs,"I am fluent in the language of BS, otherwise known
as business speak or bullshit, depending on your point of view. What is BS or business speak? Business speak is the language
we use on the job and only on the job to describe and define things. For instance, at home,
I might say to my son, ""It's time to go. Are you ready?"" While at work, I'm more likely
to say to a colleague, ""Is it scalable? You can give me
a baseline ETA on departure. (Laughter) We need to leave ASAP."" Right? I was first introduced
to the language of BS through my wife. She's a chief marketing officer
for a global consulting firm, and one day a few years back at home, she was doing a conference
call on speaker, and she started to use the language of BS. I had never heard this woman
speak this language before. I was concerned she was a spy. (Laughter) She used terms like ""boil the ocean,""
""tiger team"", ""SWOT analysis."" Afterwards, she translated
those terms to me in phrases that a human being
can actually understand. And I did what every good partner
does in a solid marriage. I made fun of those words ... (Laughter) relentlessly. I may not make as much money
as my wife's colleagues, I certainly don't have
the degrees they do, but I know a messed up thing
when I hear it. (Laughter) And I devoted years of my life to compiling, researching and then writing a BS dictionary. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) I can now tell my kids that
an auditorium full of people applauded me for all this worthless work
I did over the last few years. So in the words of BS, with this expertise I say to you that
my presentation to you today, the CTA of this DIY
TEDx Talk, if you will, is a USP on the rise of BS in our WIIFM world and how we can make
this intel less scalable during the fourth industrial revolution. (Laughter) If you don't understand
what I've just said, that's OK. You don't speak BS. (Laughter) If you do understand what I've just said, God help you. (Laughter) Yes. (Applause) So let me give it another shot. I'll translate that in more common words. The call to action
of my presentation to you is to make the point that business speak
is on the rise in our globalized economy. But there are simple things
we can all do in our day-to-day jobs with that language to take the bullshit out of BS. So what I present to you is three ways of how to take the BS
out of business speak. First, you've been sitting for a while,
so let me poll the room. I'm going to get your feet working here. I want you to stomp your feet, honestly, stomp your feet
if you know what the BS term EBITDA means. (Stomping) Nice. OK! Maybe got some CEOs,
some accountants in the room. Never know. OK, now stomp your feet if you know what earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization means. (Stomping) A little bit more. To be honest, I'm sure some of you
with amortization were like, ""I don't know if I should stomp."" Right? OK, now stomp your feet if you know what income is before applying
accounting and tax write-offs to it. (Stomping) That’s a close call, but I’m going
to make a judgment call here. The loudest stomping in this theater got to the last definition
of the same thing. EBITDA is basically income before you apply accounting
and tax write-offs to it. And notice that the most common language got the biggest agreement
from this audience. But here's the problem with BS. It is not a common language. Business speak
is the language of the elite. Not surprisingly,
when my coauthor and I, Tim Ito, researched about 300 business speak terms
for this dictionary, one of the recurring themes
is the people who created this language and speak it most fluently. A large majority of them are people
who look like me. A bunch of white guys. I say that’s not surprisingly, because I want you to think the first
and second industrial revolution, when white guys like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie
ruled the business world. And it's true today when research shows that 90 percent of all
worldwide Fortune 500 company CEOs are white guys, still. So here's a takeaway for you in the room. If you want to hang
with today's white male tycoons, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, it would benefit you to get
very adept and able to speak BS. But there's a drawback to that approach. I have a friend, Emily, who works
at a theatre company in the United States. This theater company
does corporate entertainment and keynote speeches for conferences. She started her job a few years ago and had her first big meeting
to try to make a sale. It was with a big oil company in Dallas, and across the boardroom from her
were five old white guys. And Emily noticed very early on that they did something very interesting
with their language choices. They started to use BS words
that they knew she didn't know. Now, why would they do that? Three possible reasons. I talked to Emily.
We've worked out some theories. One, these guys didn't know any better. An economist, Robin Hogarth had coined
the term ""the curse of knowledge"" to describe this phenomenon. It may be simply that they're
so expert at their language, that they don't appreciate anymore
what it's like to not know these things. And they just spoke
off the top of their head. As a corporate consultant
for public speaking, the companies that I work for, the reason I give them this advice
is because of that phenomenon. I will tell them, If you have
a lot of BS in your four walls -- and it could be unique
just to your company or it's just general acronyms and things you use
in the business world -- and you have a new employee, maybe give them a directory
of some of these terms. So instead of walking into a meeting
and smiling and nodding and then frantically googling afterwards,
what the hell does EBITDA mean, that they'll know. Second reason why
these five oil executives possibly handled Emily this way: they wanted to parse out from her
how much they knew -- how much she knew about the business. Instead of asking her directly, ""Excuse me, Emily, can you tell me how much experience
you have in our industry and let's go from there,"" they used BS as a way
to keep Emily and them apart rather than bring them together. Third possible reason
these oil executives handled it that way: they were just jerks. (Laughter) And Emily thinks that’s the answer. (Laughter) Because shortly
after her initial conversation, she brought in a more senior
male colleague, lo and behold, the five
oil executives warm up, they cut out the BS, and a deal is struck
shortly thereafter. So that's something for us to think about as our first takeaway of how
to take the BS out of business speak. Use BS to be inclusive and not exclusive. In other words, don't be a jerk. (Laughter) If you can explain something
in common language, that's a victory. The edit is the genius, not spouting off all these big words. Which brings me to my second takeaway
of how to take BS out of business speak. Let's get those feet stomping again. How many of you stomp your feet if you know what the word
""de minimis"" means? (Stomping) OK, good. I don't feel so alone because I was a like a lot of you who did not stomp your feet
a few years back. As was mentioned in my intro, I used to work for
“The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.” For those of you who don't know, it is a comedy show
that's nationally broadcast in America that satirized the news of the day. And I was interviewing an accountant about a tax issue that he used
the word ""de minimis"" to describe. And I interrupted him right there and I said, ""What?
What the F does that mean?"" And he said, ""It means small, immaterial.
It's insignificant."" To which I said, ""Well,
why didn't you just say that?"" (Laughter) And he said in a moment of honesty, he said, ""I just thought it sounded good."" (Laughter) In reality, it’s kind of
a cool word, “de minimis.” And I'm guilty of doing it, too,
especially in a business meeting where I'm unsure
of my status in that room. I may use EBITDA, right? Just to show, ""Hey,
I can hang. I can hang."" (Laughter) But here's the thing about communication. You know what's really cool
about good communication, especially in the business world? It's when you can express fresh ideas
without using stale business cliches and big words that people in the room
don't really understand. So that's my second way to take the BS
out of business language. For you. To drive this home even further, a lady that I worked with
in my corporate work works for a big American company,
one of the biggest companies in America, if not the world. She works for bosses
that use a ton of business cliches, so much so to keep herself sane, she told me she created
homemade BS bingo cards, (Laughter) replaced the numbers in the bingo cards with the phrases that they used
over and over again. So when they turned up the BS
in a conference call, she tuned out and tried to play bingo. B: Think outside the box. I: change agent. N: paradigm shift, right? So these are things for us to think about. That if we're using BS, a lot of it,
in our business speak, it may be like Shakespeare said,
""sound and fury, signifying nothing."" Which brings me to my final takeaway
of how to take BS out of business speak. Let's stick with Shakespeare. Shakespeare has given us
some great BS speak and stuff that allows itself to exist
outside of business speak in the English language. ""Wild goose chase."" Think about this.
Kind of a weird reference. That's from Shakespeare. ""Break the ice,"" ""in a pickle"" --
all from Shakespeare. The good news is when we hear
references like this from Shakespeare, a lot of us in the world at least have a little bit
of an experience with Shakespeare. And we have context clues,
we can figure it out. But I want you to think
of other cultural touchpoints that aren't as common as Shakespeare. I'm going to put up some phrases
that are commonly used in America, and if you know its common origin,
just yell it out. If you're wrong, it's OK. We'll edit it out of the video. (Laughter) ""Swing for the fences,""
""out of left field,"" ""rain check,"" “off base,” “pinch hitter,” “right off the bat,” anybody know? (Audience) Baseball! Baseball! There you go. I'm going to put up
another list of phrases. Again, you tell me
what the common origin is. ""Blind leading the blind,"" ""by the skin of your teeth,"" ""fly in the ointment,"" ""writing is on the wall."" (Audience) The Bible. The Bible. I suppose you have a Bible. You're reading scripture between speakers,
like good Christians. OK. Yeah, you're right. ""No rest for the wicked""
also comes from the Bible. Here's my point. Think of the global economy now. And the majority of people on this Earth don’t have daily experience
with American baseball, and they don't read the Bible. But you're sitting in a business meeting, saying, ""We have no time,
no rest for the wicked."" ""The writing is on the wall."" Do they know what you're talking about? Clap your hands if you've ever heard
the American phrase ""drinking the Kool-Aid."" (Applause) Great. Anybody who clapped their hands,
what does it mean? (Laughter) It's a -- What's that? (Unclear voice from the audience) We'll get there. We'll get there. (Laughter) You've read my script.
You know where I'm going. What does ""drinking the Kool-Aid"" --
What does that mean? (Audience) Succumbing to peer pressure. Succumbing to peer pressure.
It's kind of in there. It's accepting something without question. Just sort of like I did with you guys,
saying, ""Stomp your feet."" You're just like, ""Sure, whatever,"" right? Yes. And to the balcony's response, here's the origin story
of ""drinking the Kool-Aid."" And the reason why I bring this up is because it's important to know
the origin story of some of our BS. Jim Jones is a cult leader. He's adorable. 1978. He has a great idea. All of his hundreds of followers,
he's going to give them a delicious drink. That's wonderful of Jim Jones to do. He flavors it with something
called Flavor Aid, which is popular at the time. It's later confused in history with the more popular flavored drink
in America called Kool-Aid. But Jim made a bad mistake
with that Kool-Aid, man. He'd laced it with cyanide. Hundreds of followers
drink the cyanide and die. 1978. That's the origin story
of ""drinking the Kool-Aid."" The reason I bring that up
is because a European audience, you're like, ""What is Kool-Aid?"" Also, if you're born beyond 1978, you may not even know what this is. Who is this guy?
What are you talking about? Mass suicide? A cult with Kool-Aid? ""Drinking the Kool-Aid."" And there are other BS phrases
that fall in this category. We've lost the origin story,
it gets muddied. Think of TED Talk. The internet. If you type “who founded TED?”
or “where did TED come from?,” it's a person on the internet. It's Technology, Entertainment, Design. That's what TED Talks stands for. Think of the BS phrase ""piggyback."" You ever seen two pigs
with one pig on its back? (Laughter) I haven't either. Here's why. Because the origin story of this phrase
is actually ""pick back"" or ""pick pack."" But it was so commonly
misstated as ""piggyback"" that that mispronunciation was adopted,
and now it means “piggyback.” And pigs are like,
""What the hell are you talking about?"" (Laughter) And there are lots more like this. Because we're up against lunch,
I won't bore you with an origin story. It's a true one, it's horrible, about the BS phrase ""blowing smoke
up your ass,"" for example. But I won't go there. (Laughter) Here's the takeaway out of all of this, is that BS terms
can get lost in translation. And I want you to think
of some of your own cultural BS that we use around the world. For example, in America,
if a company is without money, you might say it's broke. In Italy, you would say
it's ""in the green."" In Spain, you would say
it's ""without white,"" right? In America, if you're doing
a very easy task, you might say it was ""a piece of cake."" In New Zealand, you'd say
""Bob's your uncle,"" right? If you have a very hard task
that will never happen, in America you would probably say, ""Oh, it'll happen when pigs fly."" In the Netherlands,
a Dutch worker would say, ""When the calves dance on the ice."" (Laughter) And in Russia they would say, ""When a crayfish whistles
from the mountaintop."" It means the same thing. In Japan, if you are doing a work task
and you need help, you're desperate for anybody. You may say, ""I'll adopt cat paws."" In America, if you are given a task
that is one day over a long-term project and man, you're just getting started, you may say that
it’s “a drop in the bucket.” In China, they have
the same idea communicated through the phrase of
""nine cows and only one cow thread."" So those are examples
of cultural differences with BS. And I'd be remiss to leave you for lunch without calling out
some of the regional fondness for food in your BS, in the German language. Think of yourself, when you're
in a business meeting in Germany or in Austria, with the German language, if you want to add your two cents
in America, you'd say ""two cents."" Here you say, ""I want to add my mustard."" (Laughter) OK? And once you get that mustard, you want to be “clear as dumpling broth”
about what you’re trying to say, right? You certainly don't want to come across as somebody who has “tomatoes
on their eyes,” you know? And the last thing
you want to do in that scenario is you don’t want to “talk around
the hot porridge.” OK? Which is the equivalent
of “beating around the bush” with American BS. I've given you a lot of bullshit
over a short amount of time, so I'm going to wrap it up
with a little BS language and we'll recap here. In BS, what I am trying to say is disambiguate the net net
of this dog and pony show for you thought leaders. (Laughter) And I'm going to call out
the elephant in the room with the three takeaways here. First takeaway: use BS
to be inclusive, not exclusive. Second takeaway is to make sure
that you express fresh ideas without stale business cliches or big words that maybe your audience
doesn't really understand. And then finally appreciate that a lot of our BS
is lost in translation depending on the audience. If we can all do this,
starting at lunchtime, think of how little less bullshit
there would be in the world. And what a wonderful thing that would be. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'communication', 'community', 'parenting', 'mental health', 'family', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'emotions', 'kids', 'Yvonne Newbold']",2023-08-21T09:23:37-07:00,2023-08-21T09:23:37-07:00,Science & Technology,"Tell me, have you ever seen somebody else's child behave appallingly in a supermarket? (Audience murmurs) Did you secretly blame the mum
for her lack of control? Or did you even feel a little bit smug because you knew that your child
would never behave like that? For 10 long years I was that mum
you were staring at. And those stares hurt. They made me feel
I was failing as a parent. And it wasn't just other people
who I didn't know in shops that would stare and that were judging me. That judgment came
from friends and family, from health care professionals, from school staff and from social workers. Being judged consistently
for such a long period of time diminished my self-esteem
and my self-confidence. It left me feeling crushed and broken. It had a really overwhelming impact on my ability to be able
to do anything well, including my ability to be
the best parent possible to my three children at exactly the time they really needed me
to be right at the top of my game. Now, my middle child, Toby, he's gorgeous. He is funny, he's boisterous. He loves people. But he also has a profound
intellectual disability. He's autistic and he can't talk. And that means that, sadly, Toby's also had to get used to
being judged and stared at as well. Just think what a scary place
the world must be for Toby. And he can't even ask any questions to try and help him make sense
of what's going on around him. When somebody can't talk, often, the only effective way
they have of communicating is through their behavior. And throughout Toby's childhood,
the more frightened he became, the more frightening
his behavior became as well. For those ten years,
our family lived with terrifying, violent and challenging behavior, with somebody getting hurt
nearly every single day. Now Toby had a fantastic team
of specialists around him, but nobody knew how to help. Staff had not had any training
in anxiety-led challenging behavior and there were so few, if any, services that had been developed
to support families like ours. And here we are, nearly 20 years later and nothing's changed. Instead of getting the essential help and urgent support these families need, they are instead being repeatedly and wrongfully blamed, shamed and judged for their children's anxiety-led behavior. And they're also being told
that they're being too soft and that they're spoiling their child. Throughout all those times, everyone was urging me to parent Toby
harder and stricter and more firmly. I followed their advice to the letter, but Toby's behavior got worse, not better. Of course it did. I can see that now. He was a frightened
and distressed little boy. He needed love and kindness. Being harsh and strict
was never going to work. But I didn't know that then. So I really tried
to follow all that advice. Everyone was singing
from the same song sheet, and the message was loud and clear, that I was an incompetent parent
who was failing my child and badly letting down
his brother and sister. Those years were incredibly tough and all that judgment
made it so much harder. A little bit of kindness
and an attempt at understanding could have gone to so far. Over time, in the absence
of any professional help, I eventually developed my own
wild and wacky strategies that sometimes worked. However, people then
were often as bewildered by my own decidedly odd behavior
as they were by Toby's, particularly at hospital appointments. Now, hospitals are very controlled and structured environments staffed by highly trained professionals. That's absolutely everything
that Toby is not. Toby's noisy and he's playful
and he's chaotic and he's disruptive. It was always going to be a disconnect. The other thing about Toby
is he's incredibly hospital-savvy. He can spot a healthcare
professional at 100 paces, and you're not always his favorite people. He also knows things about hospitals
that you don't know. He knows that if he's halfway down
a really long hospital corridor, if he shouts at the top of his voice, it's going to create magnificent echoes and people are going to react. Almost every time within seconds of arriving at a hospital, people were giving us a wide berth
and they were already rolling their eyes. Now, keeping Toby safe and happy
in a hospital isn't easy. But if I failed, people could get hurt
and equipment broken. So the stakes were high. I was constantly on hyper alert,
ready to leap in, to distract or divert if things looked a bit tricky. And it was essential that I was able
to communicate with Toby in ways that I knew he'd have
the best chance of understanding. Unfortunately, there wasn't always time to explain to people
what I was doing and why. So if you wanted to take Toby's blood
or to do his blood pressure, I might thrust my arm out like this and ask you to pretend
to do it to me first. Because that way, Toby has a better chance
of understanding what's going on, so he's going to be
more likely to cooperate. Toby also understands things much better if they're sung to him. So if you need to listen to his chest and he needs to lift his T-shirt up
to let you be able to do it, I might have to tell him like this: (Singing) Where is Toby's tummy? Where is Toby's tummy? Where is Toby's tummy? Show it to the doctor. (Applause) Thank you. Toby isn't naturally compliant,
but he loves playing games. So at the end of an appointment, if Toby is far too happy
sitting on your floor and emptying all your cupboards
to want to stand up and leave, I might have to play
""Where is Toby's face?"" Now, I play this by cupping my hands
like this in face shape and putting it all over the room,
saying things like, ""Is that Toby's face? Where is Toby's face? Has anybody seen Toby's face? Oh, could that be Toby's face?"" Eventually he'll cotton on
to what I'm doing, he’ll burst out laughing, he'll stand up, he'll lean his hands
into my face and great. Except that, if it's a really bad day, we may still have to perform
the entire “hooray dance” before we can leave you in peace. Now, by now, the look on the face
of the average clinician is one of sheer horror and fear. (Laughter) And there's a clear assumption
that I've lost the plot and gone bonkers. The very worst thing that can happen next is if that clinician decides
to try to take over. And ... Because they obviously can't believe
I know what I'm doing. That has meant that sometimes
Toby's been physically manhandled out of the room while he and I are both
being told off really loudly. That's almost exactly
what's guaranteed to frighten Toby into the worst type of behavior possible. Sometimes we had a fantastic experience. We've met some great people
who've been really happy to join in and play along. It's remarkable how well
a game of hide and seek can lend itself to assessments
of cognition, communication skills, mobility and even Toby's breathing. But whenever I've really felt
judged in those situations, all I've wanted to do is to run away
as fast and as far as I can out of your office. Now, when I'm feeling like that, it's almost impossible for me to open up and share with you my real concerns
about Toby's health, which means that's going to make
your job much harder in being able to assess him and to come up with treatment options, which of course is going to impact on Toby and his long-term outcomes and well-being. Being judgmental really can be
the starting place of health inequalities. But being judgmental is so easy. When you judge people
who already feel vulnerable, you're only ever going to make us feel
more ashamed, more rejected, and more unworthy. Kindness is so important. It can make such a big difference.
Kindness is powerful and it really can bring out
the best in all of us. But I've got another
favorite word: curiosity. When we stay curious, we keep asking those ""why"" questions, which helps us to build bridges
towards better understanding. When we stay curious, it keeps our hearts and our minds open, which helps to prevent us
forming those judgments. If ever you see me with Toby
and my behavior's looking a bit off, the very best question
you can possibly ask me is ""Do you need any help? And if so, what can I do?"" Eventually, we were referred
to a fantastic team who totally understood why young people like Toby can develop
these anxiety-led behaviors. Dr. Helen Simmons and David Smith. They were there for us, they listened, they just understood. They just got it. And never once did they make me feel
ashamed, blamed or judged. I was so excited that first day
that David was due to come to our house and I couldn't wait to ask him
that all-important question, ""So, David, how are we going
to change Toby's behavior?"" David put his cup of tea down. He looked at me. He took in a deep breath and then
he dropped a bombshell. ""No, Yvonne, I'm not here
to change Toby's behavior. I'm here to change yours."" ""What?"" I was not happy, I was horrified. It sounded like the same old, same old
blame judgment all over again. But it wasn't. What he was showing me
is that I had to change first. So ... I had to unlearn almost everything
I thought I knew about parenting. What I learned was about anxiety and exactly why Toby’s behavior
became so difficult, because anxiety made him so terrified. I learned that when he was lashing out, what he was really trying to do
was to scream out for help because he felt so frightened and the world was so confusing
and he needed help. I learned that when he had hurt me,
it wasn't because he hated me. It was because he trusted me
more than anybody else in the world to be able to offer him that help
that he so badly needed. So up until then, I had gone up and up and up in terms of being stricter
and harsher and firmer in the way I parented Toby, just like everybody had told me to. I thought I'd tried everything. I didn't think there was anything left. Helen and David showed me that there was an entirely
different direction and I could go down
and down and down as well. So my parenting became more loving,
more understanding, more collaborative and kinder. It changed everything. Toby responded brilliantly, and it was like watching magic happen. Toby is now 28. He's incredibly happy. He's doing so well
and things are really good. I now know that it was never
about Toby's behavior. It was always about trying to find ways to help Toby feel safer
and less frightened in a world that often seemed
confusing to him. I now run Newbold Hope. It's a parent-led organization devoted to teaching parents
and professionals how to move children
with anxiety-led behavior towards happier times. So far through our work, we know of over 2,000 children
who've successfully achieved this. We know from research that our prison population
is significantly overrepresented by adults who have ADHD or who have a learning disability or who are autistic. But it doesn't have to be like this. For decades, we've been giving
parents the wrong advice, and then we've been blaming them
when it goes even more wrong. If instead we can step in early enough and provide parents with the strategies, the support, the skills
and the confidence they need, they really can change the course
of their child's life. But this is not a parental
competence issue. Far from it. This group of parents
have taught me so much and shown me how much can be achieved with tenacity, true courage, hope and unconditional love. These parents, their parenting skills
are already at ninja level and they've helped me to realize that all that time long ago, so were mine. If you see something
that doesn't quite make sense, there may still be a clear logic
as to what they're doing and why they're doing it. Please don't judge. Please stay curious and please keep asking
those ""why"" questions. Because that's how you can help
somebody like me feel valued, understood and included. And let's be honest, isn't that what the NHS is all about? Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

#TED #TEDTalks #work","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'storytelling', 'work', 'money', 'investing', 'ideas', 'pitching', 'Mar Hershenson']",2023-09-21T08:43:30-07:00,2023-09-21T08:43:30-07:00,Science & Technology,"Do you know the secret
to successfully pitching an idea? Well, it's something kind of unexpected. It’s FOMO: the fear of missing out. [The Way We Work] As someone who invests in companies
early in their journeys, I listen to nearly 2,000 pitches a year, and I work countless hours
with company founders to help them make their pitch
even more compelling. You may equate pitching with a slick deck based on some standard format, but whether you're pitching a company or trying to get buy-in
for a passion project at work, so much of pitching
is a storytelling exercise. You need to bring people along with you. You need to tell your audience a story
that not only will draw them in, but it will make them feel
that if they don't say yes, they will be missing out
on something really big. [Step 1: Know your audience] When people think about pitching,
they're thinking inwards, they think about their nerves, how smoothly they're talking
or what it takes to get to a yes. But the secret of successful pitching
is to flip it outward. Who are you pitching to? What do they care about? How can you speak to what motivates them? For example, if you're pitching
your start-up idea to a venture capitalist who has lots of money to invest
and needs big returns, they probably care about backing
the next Uber or DoorDash. So you should focus your story
on the size of the market opportunity. If you're pitching
to a philanthropist or a nonprofit, their motivation is likely
about large social impact. So focus on showing how your product
or idea will improve things in a lasting way. If you're pitching a project at work, focus on the people
you're pitching the project to. What do they care about? More customer loyalty, more revenue, or perhaps a promotion? Tell them how your project will help them
attain the goal that they want in a way that makes it almost inevitable. Give them that feeling
of: “If I don’t support this, I'm going to miss out on something
I care about deeply."" [Step 2: Think about the hero's journey] Pitching is much like telling a story. Just like a movie tells a story. You're charting the hero's
journey in three acts. First, you start by telling
about the hero's world, the status quo. In this case, the current situation that your product, idea
or service will be addressing. Then introduce tension and conflict, showing all the problems that existing
products aren't yet addressing. This will lead you
to the big confrontation. You, the hero, swooping in
to save the day. And from there, give the resolution. How are things changed
as a result of your actions? How does your product, idea
or service solve the problems you highlighted earlier? One of the best pitches I've heard
followed this arc perfectly. The story started
with a disturbing status quo. Depending on where and how it's produced, one gallon of milk can take roughly
1,000 gallons of water to produce and can create about six kilograms
of CO2 equivalent or more in the process. In this case, the hero was the CEO
and their team of scientists and food industry experts who have come up with a way
to engineer plants to produce the animal proteins. They showed how a small crop of soybeans
could create lots of delicious cheese and how this could feed
the global population in a sustainable and yummy way. To anyone who cares about both
the environment and good food, it was an irresistible story. It made me feel
like I needed to be part of it or I would be missing out
on a big opportunity. [Step 3: Shore up your weakest point] When people are done
charting their hero's journey, I make them identify
their biggest weakness. Is it that they're missing
somebody on their team or that it's very competitive or that they're trying to do something
that has never been done before? Most people's instinct is to gloss over it
or even skip it altogether. But that's exactly the wrong thing to do because the audience will notice it
and will ask you about it. Instead, face it directly. Tell your audience, ""Hey,
you may think this is a problem, but here's exactly
what I'm going to do about it."" And by showing the strengths
and weaknesses of your story and not hiding anything, you inspire confidence not only in you
but also in your story. The best storytellers,
they live in the future, and they come here
not to just tell us about it, but to show us the steps to get there. And this makes the audience lean forward. And all they need to do to be part
of this amazing story is say yes."

#TED #TEDTalks #wildfire","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'science', 'nature', 'natural disaster', 'trees', 'weather', 'conservation', 'George T. Whiteside']",2023-07-21T04:00:24-07:00,2023-07-21T04:00:24-07:00,Science & Technology,"My wife grew up in Santa Rosa, California, and her best friend
was a woman named Joy Durand who lived on the northeast
outskirts of town. At midnight on the evening
of October 8, 2017, Joy's telephone rang. The voice said simply, ""You must evacuate now. You don't have time to pack. Fire is coming."" Joy gathered her parents
and her six-year-old son, and they hurried outside. The wildfire, which at that point
was just over the ridge from Joy's house, sounded like a jet engine
going at full throttle. The family got in their car, drove away, and within minutes,
their home had burned to the ground, incinerated by the blowtorch flames
of the Tubbs Fire. All night long, my wife got texts
and messages from friends and family, and while we didn’t know
the whole situation, it was clear that a disaster
was unfolding in her hometown. No one thought that fire could penetrate
so deeply into the city. But on that evening, 22 people lost their lives and over five thousand homes
and structures were destroyed. Wildfire is a large and growing challenge
to the West and to the world. What happened in Santa Rosa
is becoming all too common. Paradise in 2018, Australia in 2020,
Europe in 2022. And fire experts say that we should get ready
for more Santa Rosas because it's likely to get worse
before it gets better. Now beyond the major costs in lives and property and the economy, there's also a big
carbon impact to wildfire. In fact, the additional carbon
from California's 2020 wildfires was greater than the carbon that Californians had worked
so hard to save over the previous two decades. The largest fires are called megafires. These are the ones
that burn over 100,000 acres with the intensity that can threaten
aquifers and biodiversity, and even cause forest conversion, in which trees are so damaged
that they just don't grow back. These fires are getting worse as well. In fact, eight of the ten
largest megafires in California history have happened
over just the last five years. Many people feel overwhelmed
by this situation. I know I did. So two years ago,
working with great people, I closed a chapter
of my life in aerospace and I started a new journey to see if I could understand
the wildfire crisis better and what could be done about it. I started working with leaders
from firefighting and philanthropy, entrepreneurship,
science, tribal communities, and together we cofounded an organization
called Megafire Action, whose sole purpose
is to solve the megafire crisis. And I've come to believe
that if we take a holistic approach, we have an opportunity
to establish a new relationship with fire, to work safely with fire and potentially to solve
this wicked problem. The path forward has three solutions. The first is fire-adapted communities, the second is resilient landscapes and the third is
innovative fire management. So for the first,
fire-adapted communities, what we need to do is to clear the brush
and the vegetation from homes, from the immediate proximity of homes. Next, we need to
use fire-resistant materials in the homes and the roofs. And then the third thing
is to, where possible, protect against embers, flying embers, by protecting the home from openings
like your air vents and your chimneys. Now communities have
a strong shared interest to perform this work along
the exterior boundary of the community because it reduces the chance that fire will penetrate
deeply into the city, as it did in Santa Rosa. The second solution
is resilient landscapes. And if you take one lesson
from this talk, it's this. In order to solve the megafire crisis, we need to bring our western landscapes
back into a healthy balance by reducing the overgrown brush and trees
in the wildlands and the forest. Here we're finally starting
to take to heart the wisdom of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas who knew that fire was
a natural part of the landscape and who introduced low-intensity fire,
good fire, on a regular basis, at the right times. When this is done well, as around the communities
of South Lake Tahoe, then it can actually divert a megafire as bad as the one
that they experienced in 2021. It can also potentially prevent
a megafire from occurring, which is what some people think
happened in Napa of last year. But the scale of this challenge is huge. There are hundreds of millions of acres
of wildland in the American forests. The Forest Service
hopes to reduce the risk on 50 million high-priority acres
over the next ten years. But the challenge is that they're only
accomplishing a few million acres a year. And so we're not at the pace or scale that we need to do
to address this challenge. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing that we need to do is to essentially hire,
train and retain many more workers who will be doing the hard work
of defusing the time bombs inside our western forests. We need to pay them well. We need to support them
with full-time work and we need to protect them
from liability where necessary. The next thing we need to do
is to empower them with innovation. And right now there are
an incredible number of great companies and organizations that are working
to bring this innovation to reality. Just one of these companies
is called BurnBot, and what they're hoping to do is to make controlled burns
safer and faster. They're going to establish
a burned perimeter around an area with the remotely piloted rover and then they can bring a drone
into the middle of it, drop some fire into it
and burn that interior area safely. It's a brilliant but a simple idea. And I think we're going to need
a lot more of this kind of innovation if we're going to scale up
to the to the size of the problem that we have before us. Now the first two solutions
that I've talked to you about are pretty well agreed. The third one, innovative fire management,
is somewhat more controversial, but I think it offers huge potential
to address and solve the wildfire problem. What we need is innovation and technology
that can rapidly detect and assess fire and then quickly put it out
when it gets bad. And here, speed is paramount, because when you're
in the worst kind of fire days -- these are the hottest,
driest and windiest fire days -- if you can't bring fire management
resources to a fire very quickly, then it is likely that you
won't be able to contain that fire. Here we need to look at the example of the Quick Reaction Force
of Southern California, which is really designed
in some ways for these toughest days. The QRF is a public-private partnership, which now has three Chinook helicopters. These are the big ones
with the two rotors on the top. And each of them can drop
up to 3000 gallons of water on a fire, day or night, and they can do it very precisely. They can also refill
up to six times an hour so they can bring
a lot of mass to the problem. Over the course of two years
of demonstrations, the QRF has demonstrated
that this model has great potential, that, in fact, if you can bring
a lot of fire management resource to a fire very quickly, you can get on top of fires
before they get big and unmanageable. And this opens up
an exciting potential future. Imagine this model
with a series of larger drone vehicles distributed across the landscape
in higher-fire-risk areas. Imagine these vehicles
positioned periodically along utility lines or in areas of higher fire-risk
deep in the forest. Such a distributed network,
if connected to the right sensor system, could offer a future in which we are able
to really put out fires on the worst fire days,
and even in remote communities. Companies like Rain and Joby Aviation
are working on this vision today. The sensor system
will also be very important for the resolution of this problem. The system -- which will entail both ground-based,
aerial and space-based platforms -- won't be important just because
we're going to be able to see and detect fire where and when it pops up, but also because it'll enable us to differentiate
between good and bad fire, low-intensity fire
and high-intensity fire, which is very important because we need
more lower-intensity fire on the landscape to rejuvenate our forests, just as much as we need to know where and when fire risk
is becoming higher intensity. Fire is a prism through which
we can see the future of humanity's relationship
with natural systems. Working together
and supported by technology, we can build a world in which communities
are resilient to wildfire and in which forests
are brought back into a healthy balance. Ultimately, we can build a future, in which we don't just manage fire
to protect human life and property, but also to protect the biosphere
for global carbon emissions and for biodiversity. Ultimately, we need to become
the crew of Spaceship Earth. So let's get to work. Let's learn from fire and let's build a resilient,
sustainable future. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #Ukraine","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'global issues', 'war', 'energy', 'electricity', 'Countdown', 'renewable energy', 'Maxim Timchenko']",2023-07-13T04:50:12-07:00,2023-07-13T04:50:12-07:00,Science & Technology,"I’m Ukrainian. And my country is fighting
a war for survival. But there is another war
where we all must fight. Fight for the future of the planet. It's a war against climate change. Both of them have dramatic consequences
for the future of our lives. Both are killing thousands. And the root cause of both is overdependence on fossil fuels. Today, I want to explain
how Ukraine's energy challenge can help the world
to fight climate change. For decades, Russia has been weaponizing energy
to impose control over countries. It has cut gas supply during the winter, bribed us with cheap gas, built pipelines to bypass Ukraine and under-supply gas
to provoke energy shock that hurt all of us. But today, Russia moved from economic war to physical destruction
of our infrastructure, launching missiles to destroy
our power stations and grids and trying to crush the Ukrainian people. I get to see the impact every day running DTEK, one of the largest Ukrainian
power suppliers. When I wake up every morning, my first job is to see
whether we've been hit and how bad. Since the beginning of this war, our company was attacked
more than 10,000 times. A hundred of DTEK employees
have been killed on a military front line or serving on energy front line behind. These attacks expose not only
Ukraine's vulnerability, but the world's. Almost every economy on earth
depends on massive, highly centralized but easily
targeted energy systems used to extract and burn fossil fuels. But now in Ukraine,
the war is teaching something new. That relying on renewable power, we create much more resilient
and secure energy system. To understand why, 
picture a wind turbine. It's big. 700 tons and 130 metres tall. But actually, the footprint
is just a few meters. It's hard to be attacked by missiles and if they succeed one, all other
wind turbines are still running. This kind of distributed power systems combined with the energy
from household solar panels, can massively enhance energy security
of countries all over the world. And not only during war time, but against other threats
like fires and floods. Ukraine is becoming a testing ground
for a new energy future. After the first invasion in 2014, Russia destroyed or captured more
than 30 percent of DTEK power assets. Our response was to double
renewable capacity, helping Ukraine to become the country with one of the highest growth rates
of renewables in the world. One real life example
and symbol of our resilience is the Tiligulska wind farm
on the coast of the Black Sea, just 60 miles from the front line. Through the first 15 months of the war, we built wind farm
without foreign contractors, sometimes with missiles
flying above our heads and spending a lot of time
in bomb shelters. And we succeeded. From May 2023, we supply green energy
produced by this wind farm to more than 200,000 households. And we are planning
to expand this wind farm to become one of the largest
in Eastern Europe. War in Ukraine forced Europe to end its dependence
on dirty Russian energy through accelerating green transition. And Ukraine can play a key role by becoming a major supplier
of clean energy to Europe. With the right level
of foreign investments, Ukraine can build enough
renewable capacity by 2030 to supply Europe as much clean energy as countries
like Finland produce during the year. The vision of Ukraine -- greener,
and facing west towards Europe -- is even embraced by thousands
of DTEK coal miners serving on the front line against Russia. So when do we launch
this green counteroffensive? The smart move is not to wait,
but to accelerate so that we meet
the climate crisis challenge to establish energy independence and to build much more
resilient energy systems. A green transition will help
to win both of these wars and secure a lasting peace. (In Ukrainian: Glory to Ukraine)."

#TED #TEDTalks #AI","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'science', 'sustainability', 'technology', 'energy', 'AI', 'Wind energy', 'machine learning', 'Sims Witherspoon']",2023-09-21T04:00:21-07:00,2023-09-21T04:00:21-07:00,Science & Technology,"You may have had the experience
of unboxing furniture and come across instructions
that go something like this: ""Assemble the bookshelf
according to the provided diagram."" Yes, I know what a bookshelf looks like. Probably wouldn't be reading
the assembly instructions if I didn't need a little more help
with the process. Or maybe you've opened a cookbook with an author who thinks
you're already somewhat of a chef. ""Deglaze the pan."" What? (Laughter) OK, off I go on a separate search
to understand whatever that means. Instructions that tell you what to do
and not how to do it are pretty useless. And yet, even when we're talking about something as important
as climate change, we hear them all the time. “Transition to renewable energy.” “Electrify everything else.” “Deploy solutions
that are equitable and fair.” Yes, let's do all of that. But how? Answering how is where we understand
which solutions are actually feasible, whether that be
with today's infrastructure, our evolving regulatory environment or any of the other number
of dependencies and constraints that we have to consider. How we solve climate change also depends on our very
definition of the problem. It's a scientific challenge,
a sociopolitical issue, an economic problem and so much more. And how we solve it
will depend on how we frame it. There is no single answer. I'm a scientist, so I approach climate change
as a scientific challenge. I'm also a techno-optimist and artificial-intelligence
product manager, so I also approach it
as a technological one. When it comes to a sustainable future, artificial intelligence can help us
do three critical things. First, it can help us
understand climate change and its effects on Earth's ecosystems. Second, it can help us optimize
current systems and infrastructure, because we can't just start over
from scratch today. And third, it can help us accelerate
the breakthrough science we need, such as fusion
as a carbon-free energy source. Today, I'd like to talk
about that second one, optimizing current systems, and specifically, how we can use AI
to harness a superpower we already have in this fight: wind energy. Renewables are unquestionably
a key to a sustainable future, but the problem is they're unpredictable. Sometimes, the sun shines
and the wind blows, and sometimes, it just doesn't. Now, for an electricity systems operator, who needs supply
to meet demand in real time, 24-7, this is hugely problematic. Renewables can't be
100 percent reliably scheduled. Now, unfortunately,
fossil-fuel plants are the opposite. You can burn a specific amount
of coal at a set time to deliver exactly the amount
of electricity you want in a predictable time window. So ... if you're a power systems manager whose job is to literally
keep the lights on, which source are you
more confident depending on? But here's one of the places
where AI can come in. It is a powerful tool for forecasting. AI systems can ingest
vast amounts of historical data and help us predict future events. So, while we can't eliminate
the variability of wind, we can use AI to more accurately
predict its availability. That was my team’s “what” to do. Use AI to accelerate the transition
to renewables, like wind energy. The tough part was the “how” to do it. First, we researched the challenge. We read papers,
we spoke to domain experts, we found out everything we could
about the problem. Our team, which is a mix
of research scientists, engineers, a product manager,
a program manager and an impact analyst, decided that a neural net
trained on historical weather data and turbine power-production information would likely help us accomplish our goal. Next, we needed to find two core elements: data to train the system and a partner
who was willing to deploy it. Both of these can be major obstacles when it comes to deploying AI
in real-world scenarios. Let's start with data. There are massive gaps
in climate-critical data -- not just in electricity, but in agriculture, transportation,
industry and many other sectors. Some of our data, we could purchase
or download for free -- weather forecasts, for instance. But some of the data we needed
was proprietary, and this would be, like,
turbine power-production information and other operational data
from the wind farms. Now, we needed that proprietary data
so that we could train our models to learn the relationship
between historical weather and historical power production, so it could then then make predictions
about future power availability based on what data said
about future weather. Now it's probably worth mentioning here that we were looking
at a few years of data on hourly resolution, not historical data at a timescale that would have massive climactic
differences from present day. In addition to data, we needed to find a partner
with domain expertise and the willingness and scale
to test new systems. You know, surprisingly,
this can be a major hurdle when it comes to deploying AI
in the real world. Believe it or not,
it's not every wind-farm manager that wants to let a bunch
of AI researchers test on their multimillion-
or multibillion-dollar systems. But the thing is,
in order to prove that AI works, we have to have deployment
opportunities in the real world. Luckily for us, Google
was a ready and willing partner. OK, yes, DeepMind is a part of Google, but it's not a given that they would
let us test on their systems. Yet they let us test on 700 megawatts
of their wind-power capacity, which is equivalent to a large wind farm
in the United States. This made them an excellent proxy
for external wind-farm operators. They also lent us an expert team
to advise on metrics and benchmarks and to share the data that we needed. This is another critical component of AI
for the real-world deployments. Working with a domain-expert team
that can tell you what they need, how they need it to work, which constraints keep the system safe, what quantifiable metrics to use
to measure AI performance and how much better
that AI performance needs to be than their previous systems to make the cost
of switching over even worth it. And that's just to name a few. So at this point, we have our idea, we have our data,
we have our deployment partner. Now, to test and deploy our system. Improving the accuracy
of electricity-supply forecast is incredibly important. If predictions are higher
than actual generation, renewable electricity managers may not
have enough supply to meet demand. This, in turn, drives the purchase
of carbon-intensive fossil fuels to cover that gap, because they're largely
what makes up backup generation. Now, the good news. Our AI system performed 20 percent better
than Google's existing systems. Even better news is that Google
decided to scale this technology. And scaling is so important. We will run out of time
in the climate countdown if we aren't deploying solutions
that are widely applicable. This particular solution
is being developed into a software product that French company Engie
is among the first to pilot. But, you know, it doesn't even take a major research
organization to do this kind of work. Where we focused on AI
for supply-side forecasting, a small UK-based nonprofit
called Open Climate Fix is focusing on AI
for demand-side forecasting. They found a willing partner
in the UK National Grid, and are currently deploying forecasts
that are two times more accurate than the UK grid's
previously used systems. Now, all of this is to say
is that AI can help us with the transition to renewable energy, but scientists and technologists, we're not going to be able
to do that alone. We need to be working
with partners and experts who can teach us the “how.” So for those of you
interested in this space, if you're a domain expert, please share the problems you face
and the challenges that you have so that our sector can ensure that AI pursuits will have impact
in the real world and not be purely academic. Even better, if you want to incentivize
ML researchers to work on your problems, I'll let you in on a little secret: build a competition, and they will come. (Laughter) It's true. Just don't forget
the datasets and metrics. If you are a data holder,
where it’s safe and responsible to do so, please share data
related to those challenges. If you're not sure whether the data
you have is even climate-critical, you can check out
Climate Change AI's website, where they have published a wish list
of climate-critical datasets. Access to these datasets would unblock crucial research
and innovation in AI for climate. If you're a deployment partner, please, let us know who you are, especially if you're willing
to test innovative systems. And for everyone
who's interested in this space, please know you do not have to be
technical to work in tech. AI for climate action
requires a variety of skill sets and a diversity of backgrounds that, yes, includes research
scientists and engineers, but it also includes
ethicists and policy experts, communication teams, product managers, program managers and so many more folks. Now for the warning label. AI is not a silver bullet. It will not solve all problems
driving climate change. It isn't even the right tool
for many of the challenges that we face. AI is also not a technology
without tensions. It needs to be deployed
safely and responsibly. Not to mention, until our grids are run on clean energy,
AI itself will carry a carbon footprint, as will any energy-intensive
technology we use. But AI can be a transformational tool
in our fight against climate change -- it's just on all of us
to wield it effectively. The “why” we need to
is absolutely harrowing. The “what” we can do is really exciting. But it’s the “how” we can do it that will illuminate feasibility
and help us drive impact. So, in your next
climate action conversations, when someone presents you
with an exciting ""what,"" please help to advance the conversation to the impactful ""how."" Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

Rivera']",2023-10-10T08:12:00-07:00,2023-10-10T08:12:00-07:00,People & Blogs,"People feel pretty disconnected
at work right now: disconnected from their
organizations, from their jobs, and especially from their colleagues. You might feel too burned out
to do anything about this last one or maybe think that it doesn't matter. But actually, our relationships
with our coworkers play a huge role
in determining how successful, innovative and happy we'll be at work. [The Way We Work] Our work relationships
give us two valuable things: social support and access to information. And research shows it's the combination that can make us happier
and more successful. I'm a social scientist and I study how the way we collaborate
affects our well-being and professional success. I have a few tips, and you don't have to be
a social butterfly to give them a try. OK, tip number one. Build trust by opening up. Having a close friend at work
makes us more effective at our jobs and definitely improves our well-being. If you get along with your coworkers,
you probably already have a sense of this, but our work friends are important
for another reason and it has to do with access
to information. People don't just share
their best ideas with anyone. We share with people we know and trust. I ran a multi-year study at Google to find out why some teams
are successful and others fail. And what we found is that the teams
who trust each other do so much better because people on those teams
feel safe sharing their best ideas. So how can you start to build that trust? There's a concept
called a vulnerability loop, and the basic idea is that when
you’re vulnerable in front of somebody, it makes it a lot easier for them
to be vulnerable in front of you. We usually think you have to trust
somebody before you can open up. But what this research
suggests is that often, trust comes after we've been vulnerable
and people have responded empathetically. So taking that risk to share
that this week you feel a little off because your kid's
starting at a new school or maybe you’re really worried
about the status of your big project, that can actually go a long way
towards building a sense of trust that can make you and your teams
much more effective. OK, tip number two, be a joiner. Surprisingly, our closest friends
aren't the best people for giving us access to new information. It's often our acquaintances because they connect us
to different social circles and consequently new ways of thinking. Social scientists call these
relationships weak ties, and when it comes to innovation, they're more important
than our strongest connections. For example, in one study, I found that people who had many weak ties that connected different groups
in a large organization were more likely
to have high performance scores, more likely to be promoted and even more likely to say they were
a part of a creative breakthrough. The best way I've seen
for developing weak ties is to join groups outside
of your day-to-day work. Things like philanthropic organizations, sports clubs or employee resource
groups are great examples. You never know. Tobin from Legal, who you met
playing pickleball, might have a great idea that can really help you out
in your next project. And for leaders trying
to spark innovation, having a regular trivia group
might be more effective the best-run strategy summit. OK, this last tip is especially
helpful for managers. Tip three: Make it a little bit easier
for people to belong to something. A number of years ago, I helped redesign the onboarding
process at a big company. At the time, the onboarding week
was maybe informative, but it didn't do a lot to create
meaningful connection. So I ran an experiment. Every week, I assigned new employees
to one of five groups, each with a different colored T-shirt, and something amazing started to happen. Almost immediately, people wearing yellow T-shirts
started having breakfast together. People in the green T-shirts started walking between
the different sessions together. And at the end of the week, we blew by our happy hour budget
because people hung out together so much longer than they ever had. The best part is,
after that onboarding week, many of those people
stayed in touch for years, which became a great source
of weak ties across the organization. The reason the T-shirt
experiment worked so well is because it gave people an easy way
to identify the group they belong to. You could be creative here. Even things like swag, T-shirts
and project code names can go a long way towards creating
a sense of belonging. Look, people feel really isolated
and disconnected right now. That's not surprising, we've all just been
through a global pandemic. The best part about reconnecting
is that it doesn't just benefit you, it benefits the whole community
that you help create."

specifically male. My name is X. I am landing here and we share a common social identity and common communication pool."" For a pickup line by a bat, not bad. Scientists have recorded millions 
of bat vocalizations like this and they've decoded many of them using AI. And they've revealed that 
bats have dialects that they pass down from 
one generation to the next, and that baby bats learn to 
speak just like you did, by listening to the adults around them and babbling back until they speak adult bat."

#TED #TEDTalks #weather","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'enviornment', 'science', 'nature', 'natural disaster', 'weather', 'Countdown', 'Al Roker']",2023-09-18T04:00:34-07:00,2023-09-18T04:00:34-07:00,Science & Technology,"I first started doing television weather
in 1974 when I was a sophomore in college, and I have seen a lot of changes
that I know you have. From history-making hurricanes, we're talking about
record-breaking blizzards. I've been -- (Laughter) Yeah, OK, laugh at my suffering. I'm glad you feel that good. Hurricane Sandy, this was really,
to me, a game changer as far as climate, when people realized what was going on. Hurricane Ida, which came onshore, causing massive problems
not just at landfall but also as it moved inland
causing massive, massive flooding. A lot of us recently experienced
dangerous air quality because of wildfires up in Canada, that smoke stretched
as far south as Atlanta. We're also experiencing
atmospheric rivers, cyclogenic bombs of low pressure. We’ve also looked at rising
ocean levels and, of course, paralyzing winter storms,
stretching from Texas into the northeast, unprecedented heat and flash flooding all within the last couple of weeks. If we were to talk
about everything that's going on, all these extreme weather events that have been happening
in the last couple of years, we would literally be here
for a couple of hours. So we just wanted to take a look
at some of the extreme weather events that are being fueled by climate change. So we boiled it down
to a few key bullet points, talking about hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires. And literally this is the tip
of the iceberg when it comes to climate change. Let's talk about, for example, hurricanes. Did you know that between 2016 and 2019, we had four straight years
with Category 5 hurricanes? That's the top of the level. That is unprecedented. And beyond the increasing frequency, hurricanes are also
intensifying more rapidly. We're seeing that happen time
and time again with these hurricanes as they approach shore. And this is because
the environment is favorable, because the ocean waters have heated up. Now, let's talk about tornadoes. Same thing goes for this. Studies have shown an increase
in tornado frequency, more EF2 tornadoes in the Midwest
and the Southeast. There's actually been
a diminution of those tornadoes in the traditional tornado belt. They have moved east, south and north in areas that are a lot more prevalent
with larger populations. And we're talking about more
tornadoes during winter, which is really something that we
haven't seen in the last ten years. Wildfires. OK, we know about the wildfires
that happen out West, and the average acreage burned
in warm season has nearly doubled. There is no more wildfire season out West. And the folks out West were laughing
at us in the East saying, ""Hey, get used to it. This is what we've been seeing."" We're getting used to bad air quality. And in fact, the intensity
from these frequent wildfires has led to the deterioration
of our lifestyle, our air quality, loss of property and crops. It is just really one of these things
that is changing how we live. But what happens to those folks
who actually struggle? Struggle with the actual
impacts of climate change? Now, we've known for years
that communities that are most vulnerable
to the effects of climate change are the ones that are least responsible
for climate change itself. In fact, the most recent Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, estimates that in the next 30 years,
and that's not that long, 140 million people
will be displaced worldwide. That's more than the population of Russia. That's how many people
we're talking about. Here in the United States, federal government has had to start
to compensate Indigenous communities because they've had to move
because of sea level rise and warming of the atmosphere. We were recently in Alaska
and saw the change that has happened to the Indigenous
communities there because of their lifestyle, their community and their heritage
is being lost because of this. Now about 75 percent of the world lives under the poverty line
in rural areas. And these are the same areas whose natural resources
are being undermined and destroyed by extreme drought,
torrential rainfall and wildfires. And even though they try
to do what they can, these events often force these communities
from their very homes, changing their lives,
their communities and their culture. Now, outside of our cultural communities, climate change has an effect
on our national security. And that change of climate
is going to affect the ability to train war fighters, to maintain facilities at home and abroad and to be able to operate effectively
with a fighting force because of climate change. And in fact, a recent report
by the Rand Corporation highlighted how climate change
is already affecting military sites all around the world because of the diversion of funds to have to harden these sites
against climate change. And you think about vulnerability, one of the things we have to think about,
the people who work outside, in one of the earlier sessions, we had some farmers here
talking about this. Well, farmers, farm workers, outdoor industries, construction workers,
even our kids at summer camps, they have to change how they work
because of hotter and hotter summers. Now what can we do? How do we change things? How do we get those solutions going that help us harden ourselves
against climate change? Well, one of the most impactful
options is electrification. Sure, we think about cars,
but what about stoves? What about lawnmowers, leaf blowers? In fact, a recent automotive test -- think about this, running
a leaf blower for 30 minutes adds more pollution to the atmosphere than an F-150 truck driving 3,800 miles. (Audience) Whoa! One leaf blower. And not to mention the noise. You change over
to an electric leaf blower ... OK -- (Applause) I'm not sure if you're against
electric or leaf blowers, but you should be for both. And of course, everybody will appreciate it,
not only your neighbors, but your animal neighbors as well. And in fact, when we talk about our lawns, because a lot of lawn care goes into this, we need to stop thinking about,
you know, that green, lush lawn. Let's rethink that to using
more shrubbery, more brushes, more drought-resistant plants. It’s called xeriscaping. So that there’s less green
as far as lawns, well-manicured lawns, and more natural, indigenous plants
that help conserve water and help the actual planet
keep that water in. And then there's another area
that we can talk about. I know you look at me and you think, ""Yes, he's fashionable. Yes, he's GQ."" Right? OK. Well, the fact of the matter is,
you know, fast fashion, that is just a real detriment
for our environment. It's cheap, quick, mass-produced fashions that are meant to be discarded, fill up our landfills, cause pollution
because of the dyes that are used. So what you end up doing is adding to landfills
and spending a lot of money. Instead, find good, durable,
sustainable clothing that's going to last more than one season and you help reduce our landfills
and causing more problems. And look good doing it, too. (Laughter) And lastly, the most important thing. Engagement. You have to be engaged. You have to know,
let your elected officials know that this is important to you. You have to vote. You have to vote. You have to go out there
and support politicians who are going to support our planet. You know, one of the things
that has changed my outlook in a very short period of time. Nine days ago, I became a grandpa. (Cheers and applause) I thought you’d pause and think,
“He’s not old enough.” But. Obviously that's not the case. But I was holding my new granddaughter,
Sky, which is -- I love the name. Aww. And I was literally, on Tuesday, sitting about two hours, holding her, while I let my daughter
and her husband get a break. And I was thinking about giving this talk. And I was thinking about, what kind of world is she going to have? I mean, let's face it. I'm only going to be here, if I'm lucky,
maybe another 15 years. Who knows? But it's her world. All of our grandkids and their kids,
it's going to be their world. What world are we leaving them? This younger generation
is going to fight this fight. So support them. Support politicians who decide
that our planet and its health is the more important thing, that climate change is the most
existential threat to our survival. And make sure that you do what you can. Be conscious of the decisions you make. We can all get together and make each individually come together and make a great change
and change our planet. Thank you very much. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'business', 'communication', 'work', 'personal growth', 'TEDx']",2023-10-14T04:00:20-07:00,2023-10-14T04:00:20-07:00,Science & Technology,"Back in 1482, a young man heard that the region of Milan
was looking for an engineer, so he did what job applicants do. He wrote down his skills
and his objectives and how they related to the role in what is thought to be
the first resume ever created. That young man was Leonardo da Vinci. You see, Da Vinci, in his resume,
never put anything down about his past achievements. For context, Da Vinci was one
of the most talented people to ever walk on the face
of the planet, right? He was the father of architecture
and palaeontology, an expert botanist,
astronomer and cartographer. The guy that painted the Mona Lisa. Yet if you took a look at his resume, you would never guess that he was capable
of achieving any of those things. If resumes failed to capture
the genius and the potential of someone like Da Vinci, why do we think that it'll
work for you and me? Why will they work for anyone? Centuries later, why do resumes play such an important part
in recruiting and our careers despite little to no evidence
that they actually work? In fact, since the 1950s, they've become a mainstay
in the job application process. And although we have since
put a man on the moon, cracked the human genome,
created a metaverse and somehow kept up
with all of the Kardashians, the biggest -- (Laughter) the biggest innovation
when it comes to resumes has been converting it from paper to PDF. Why are we not questioning this? Where we have seen innovation
is with applicant tracking systems, bots, AI that scan thousands
and thousands of resumes looking for keywords
that match the job description. These bots are used by nearly
all Fortune 500 companies, so although most of the time
you're preparing your resume for it to be reviewed
by another human being, they often get rejected by AI
before it even reaches a person. If this is all news to you
and you're looking for a job, then you’re playing the job search game,
and you don’t know the rules. Hardly anyone does. And the problem there
is that AI still has a long way to go, and machine learning is nowhere near to making predictions
on candidates’ success. I've been working in HR now
for more than a decade. During this time, I've reviewed
thousands of resumes and made many countless hiring decisions. Which, by default, makes me
the resume doctor for everyone that knows me. You see, whenever a friend,
a friend's friend, their husband, their wives, their kids, their friends
are looking for a job, I'm the first person they call
when they need help with their resume. Irrespective of where
they are in their careers, there's all this insecurity and anxiety
when it comes to their resume. Why do people get so nervous
about something so silly as updating a resume? We've all been there, up late at night, trying to apply
for that dream role, obsessing over each
bullet point and detail. As if, if we spend 20 more
minutes on the resume, it'll somehow be perfect. It will become the ideal resume. As if the ideal resume exists. It doesn't, it's very subjective. And because of that,
there's so much conflicting information. Depending on who you ask,
resume should only be one page long. Others say two pages long. Others suggests a summary or objectives. Others say try and make it
visually pleasing. You can't have too much white space, but if you have too much text,
it just looks too busy. And then there's all these articles online that deep dive into the minutia
all the way to the absurd when it comes to resumes, arguing about things like font psychology and how using a sexy font
like Arial or Calibri -- (Laughter) will better serve you in your job search versus a boring one like Times New Roman. (Laughter) Who would have thought
that that would have any correlation with how good you could do the job? And the absurdity continues. Hobbies and interests. Do you include them,
or do you leave them out? If you leave them out, does it make your resume
look too impersonal? If you leave them in,
what if your hobbies are weird? (Laughter) What if you enjoy dressing up
like Pokemon characters or collecting Beanie Babies? Will that cost you a job? During the entire time, as you're spiraling down this rabbit hole, you're not questioning the tool
or the process itself. You're questioning yourself. Is it me? Am I the problem? The answer is no. Resumes are a terrible metric
for assessing who you are at work, and the world of work
is constantly evolving. There was a time,
10 years into your career, you had two to three jobs at most. Now it's common for people
to change jobs once every year and have multiple side hustles, too. Those student loans are not going
to pay for themselves, right? A resume doesn't do you justice
if you have a non-traditional path. And a non-traditional path
is now the norm. Although corporate America
has made a ton of progress in the way of equity and inclusion, relying on resumes is a magnet
for discriminatory practices and unconscious bias. More specifically, when Black and Asian candidates
whiten their names, they're more successful
in their job search. The same applies to when women
change their name to a man's. But men were not immune to this either, and we often get rejected for roles
in female-dominated fields. The pressure to fit your experience
on one piece of paper for experienced candidates
can be too much. And studies have shown
that candidates as young as their 30s face ageism with resume sourcing. So you can imagine
what the experience is like for someone coming out of retirement. Don't believe me? Try applying for an entry-level role
with an AOL.com email account. (Laughter) The great resignation has forced employers
to revisit how they evaluate, treat and reward their employees, but also how they attract new ones. But they're having candidates go
through the same stupid process expecting different results. As in, ""Here's the job description,
send us your resume, let's take six to seven
seconds to review it,"" rinse and repeat. And then they wonder why
they're not getting enough candidates. So let's rethink one of the most
redundant benchmarks for entry into any type of role. Summarizing a lifetime of achievements
isn't just hard for someone like Da Vinci. It's hard for everyone else. During a time where we celebrate
authenticity and creativity, why are we asking for something
so conformative and, frankly, boring? We can do better. Resumes not only force you to lie
about your experience, they force you to use
all these silly buzzwords that you would never use
in the context of a real conversation. Like ""orchestrated"" or ""spearheaded."" People don't talk like that. Who are you, Dr. Evil? (Laughter) Yet if you're honest, you're just increasing your chances
of getting rejected. So what can we ask
as an alternative to a resume? Well, we can conduct
online skills assessments or request portfolios of work, like they already do
in certain industries. We can ask for a video testimonial so we can assess one
of the most important skills in any type of role -- communication. We can leverage technology
to have candidates team with each other to solve a problem so we can assess
how they work with other people. We can put candidates through simulations
or situational assessments like an in tray exercise so we can see
how they act in a specific scenario. Even better, we can gamify the entire
process to engage candidates. This could be an online quiz
or a challenge that would motivate
goal-driven professionals. Heck, we can even invite candidates
to our offices to solve a problem and then purposefully
slow down their internet, just so we can see
how they react under pressure. But joking aside, the list goes on and on. Better leveraging technology, being more creative and having different options
for people to apply will not only produce
a better talent pool, it will also create a much
more equitable workplace. And I know a lot of people
won't agree with me. They'll say mixing things up
costs time and money, but hiring the wrong person
has a higher price. Almost 30 percent of their annual salary plus all the time it took
for you to train them. Subsequently, it's all about building trust
and a culture of belonging. If you ask any CEO about their culture,
they'll say it's unique. But to apply to be a part of it is exactly the same as their competitors, which not only limits their options, they end up competing
for the same type of talent which results in workplaces
that lack diversity. If your culture is inclusive, have people choose how they want to apply so they can customize their experience and put their best foot forward. Ultimately, there are better
alternatives than the resume, and maybe we don't need
to get rid of them completely. But do we need to obsessively rely on them just for the sake of what we're used to? You don't need to be as talented or gifted or even have as much free time
on your hands as Da Vinci to learn from him that you don't need
to be defined by your resume. And once employers realize this, then we'll begin creating workplaces
that feel welcoming to candidates even before they join. Plus, it will give us enough time
to rethink cover letters, because those are really terrible. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'technology', 'design', 'engineering', 'computers', 'future', 'decision-making', 'TEDx']",2023-09-05T04:00:39-07:00,2023-09-05T04:00:39-07:00,Science & Technology,"Alright, well, let's start
with an easy question. How many of you are wearing
a Fitbit or an Apple Watch or some other kind
of health tracking device? And how many of you have got
a smartphone with you here today? Maybe I should say
how many of you have not? The fact that so many of us have
these technological marvels in our pockets or on our body is a sure sign of the revolution
that's taking place in computing over the last decade. And I want you to think
with me for a second about the elements of that revolution. So first off, are the data. These devices are collecting data
about our health, our movements, our habits and more. And what's really important is that those data
are not generic population data, but they're data
that are personalized to us, each as an individual. Second, and just as important,
are the models. Inside these devices are very powerful mathematical and statistical models. Some of these models
are learned entirely from data, perhaps a machine-learning model
that has learned to classify whether I'm running
or walking or biking or sleeping. Some of these models are based in physics, such as a physiological model
that describes the equations that represent cardiac function
or circadian rhythm. And now where things
get really interesting is when we start to put
the data and the models together. Mathematically, this is known
as data assimilation. So we have data and we have models. With data assimilation,
we start updating the models as new data are collected from the system. And we don't do this update just once,
but we do it continually. So as the system changes, as I get older and my circadian rhythm or as my cardiac function
is not what it once was, the new data is collected
and the models are evolving and following along with me. Now that data assimilation
is really important because it's what personalizes
the models to me and that then gets us
to the fourth element, which is the element of prediction. Now that I have these personalized models, it's so powerful because I can now get predictions
or recommendations that are tailored to me as an individual and that are tailored to my dynamically
evolving state over my life. So ... what I’m describing, this working together of data and models, is likely very familiar to all of you because it's been driving your personal
choices in retail and entertainment and wellness for many years. But what you might not know is that a similar revolution
has been taking place in engineering systems. And in engineering systems,
the story is much the same. We have data and we have
increasing amounts of data as sensors have become smaller, lighter,
cheaper and more powerful. In engineering, we also have models. Our models are usually
grounded in physics. These models represent
the governing laws of nature. They're powerful models
that let us predict how an engineering system will respond. What you see up here on the slide
is a picture of the unmanned aircraft that I have in my research group that we use for a great deal
of our research. And for this aircraft, we have powerful finite element models that let us predict
how the aircraft structure will respond under different conditions. So these models let us answer questions like, will the structure of the aircraft
hold together on takeoff if I design it in this way? Or, what happens if the aircraft
wing gets damaged and I continue to fly it aggressively? Will the aircraft hold together? And again, just like the Fitbit
and the smartphone example, we can put the data
and the models together to build a personalized model
of the engineering system, a personalized model of the aircraft. And we call this personalized
model a digital twin. So what is a digital twin? It is a personalized, dynamically evolving model
of a physical system. And I want you to think
about the digital twin of my aircraft. So as I create that digital twin, I'm going to be collecting data
from the sensors on board the aircraft. I'm going to be collecting
data from inspections I might make of the aircraft, and I'm going to be assimilating
that data into the models. And what's really important is that I’m not building a generic model
of just any old Telemaster aircraft. I am building a personalized model of the very aircraft that is right now
sitting in my garage down the road in South Austin. And so that digital twin
will capture the differences, the variability from my aircraft
to say, my neighbor's aircraft. And what's more, that digital
twin will not be static. It's going to change
as my aircraft ages and degrades and gets damaged and gets repaired. We will be assimilating data all the time and the digital twin will follow
the aircraft through its life. So this is incredibly powerful. I want you to imagine now
that you're an airline or maybe in a few years’ time,
you’re an operator of a fleet of unmanned
cargo delivery drones, and imagine that you would have
a digital twin like this for every vehicle in your fleet. And think about what that would mean
for your decision making. You could make decisions
about when to maintain any one aircraft, depending on the particular
evolving state of that aircraft. You could make decisions
about how to optimally fly an aircraft on any given day, given the health of the aircraft,
given the mission needs, given the environmental conditions. It would really let you optimally
manage that fleet of aircraft. So this idea of a digital twin
is pretty neat. The term “digital twin” was coined
in 2010 in a NASA report. But the idea, this idea
of a personalized model combining models and data, is much older. And many people
point to the Apollo program as being one of the places where digital twins
were first put into practice. So in the Apollo program,
back in the '60s and the '70s, NASA would launch Apollo
spacecraft up into space, and they would also deploy a simulator, a virtual model on the ground in Houston, to follow along on the mission. And now this became very important and it became very useful
in the Apollo 13 mission. And again, perhaps you all know the story
because we've seen the movie. In the Apollo 13 mission,
the spacecraft suffered a malfunction. It was very badly damaged. It became stranded up in space. And so the story goes that NASA were able
to take the data from the real aircraft, the physical twin stuck up in space, feed it into the simulator
and to the virtual models on the ground in Houston, do the data assimilation, dynamically evolve the simulator so now that it represented
the conditions of the damaged spacecraft and then use that simulator
to run predictions and ultimately guide the decisions that brought the astronauts
back home safely. So more than 50 years later, this idea now has a really great name, the name of digital twins. And what's really exciting is that it's moving well beyond
just aerospace engineering. So in our engineered world, we're starting to see digital twins
of bridges and other civil infrastructure for structural health monitoring
and predictive maintenance. We're starting to see digital twins
of buildings for energy efficiency, digital twins of wind farms to increase efficiency
and to reduce downtime. In the natural world, there's a lot of interest
in creating digital twins of forests, farms, ice sheets,
coastal regions, oil reservoirs and even talk of trying to create
a digital twin of planet Earth. And in the medical world, there's a great deal of interest
in creating digital twins to help guide medical assessment, diagnosis, personalized treatment
and in silico drug testing. So, many, many exciting
potential applications of digital twins. But now, I would not like you
to leave my talk today thinking that all of this is a reality, that we can create digital twins today
of all those complex systems. It's still beyond reach to create
a digital twin of an entire aircraft. It's still beyond reach to create
a digital twin of a cancer patient or of planet Earth. Creating digital twins of these very,
very complex systems is very, very challenging. And let's think for a minute
why it's so challenging. So one reason it's very difficult
is because of the scales that these systems cross. If you think about my aircraft, damage at the microscopic level on the material on the wing
of the aircraft translates across scale to impact the way the vehicle flies
at the vehicle level. In medicine, we all know that, again, changes at the very fine level, at the molecular or the cellular
level in our bodies translate across scales to have impacts
on us at the system level, at the human level. And computational models
that resolve all of these scales, from the microscale all the way up
to the system level, are computationally intractable. We can't solve them even with today's
supercomputing power. But then you might say,
""OK, well what about the data? You said we had a lot of data. Can we not just learn
digital twins from data?"" So yes, we live in an era of big data and we have a lot of data
often for our systems. But when it comes
to these very challenging, complex systems in engineering,
in science and in medicine, the data by themselves
are almost never enough. The data are almost always very sparse
in both space and in time. The data are almost always noisy
and they're indirect. As an engineer, I can almost never measure
what it is I want to know. If I want to know about the health
on the structure inside my aircraft wing, I can't just break it open
and take a look. I am limited to those few sensors
that are on the surface of the wing, taking those measurements
and then trying to guess. More than guess, trying to infer
what's happening inside the wing. The same is true in medicine. A medical practitioner can't open
somebody up to take a look at an organ. Again, we are limited to sparse, noisy and indirect observations
taken from the outside to try to infer what's going on. So then you might say, ""Well, we just have to wait a few years because sensing technology will get
better and better and better."" And that's true. Maybe, maybe then we'll have enough data to really be able to characterize what is going on inside
these very complex systems. But even that's not enough, because all that would tell us
is what's happening now. And remember, we have
to do more than that. We have to be able to predict
what might happen in the future if we take different actions. So we're always going to need the models. So this sounds like a huge
challenge, and indeed it is. But the good news is that we have a lot
of hope for addressing this challenge. And a big part of this hope rests on this notion of predictive
physics-based models. These are the models that encode
the governing laws of nature that let us make predictions -- predict how a cancer tumor might grow or how a cancer tumor might respond
to radiotherapy treatment, or predict how an Antarctic
ice sheet might flow under different future
temperature scenarios. And bringing these predictive
physics-based models together with powerful machine learning, with scalable methods and data simulation and optimization and decision making, and with high performance computing, that's the realm of the interdisciplinary
field of computational science, and that's the focus of the Oden Institute here at UT Austin, where we bring together faculty from 24 different
departments across campus to tackle these kinds
of challenging problems. So I’m going to close
by provoking your imagination and I hope you’re excited, like I am,
about the idea of a digital twin. And maybe as you go home,
you can look around and think, ""Oh, what if we had
a digital twin of that?"" But let's look at some examples
of some of the really exciting areas where digital twins
could make a difference in tackling some of the biggest
problems facing society. And as I go through this, you'll also see some
of the really exciting research that we have going on here at UT Austin. So the first area is space systems. You probably all know,
we are at the dawn of a new space era. It is so exciting and it's
so exciting for our students. And what's even more exciting
is that central Texas is right in the midst of that new era. So digital twins clearly have a role
to play in managing the health and the operations of space systems,
of launch vehicles, of satellites. You can see here,
this is some of the work that I'm doing together with my
colleagues from the Cockrell School, Renato Zanetti and Srinivas Bettadpur. Digital twins also have
a big role to play in tracking and managing space objects
and space debris. And here at UT Austin, we have one of the world's
leading experts in this area, that's Moriba Jah. Moriba is building digital twins
for space domain awareness. If we think about the environment
and geosciences, again, digital twins could play such a role here. This picture you see,
Omar Ghattas's, high-resolution, physics-based model
of the Antarctic ice sheet, which is put together with observational
data of all different kinds to understand what might be going on, to help guide decisions
about where to drill ice cores, where to take observations, and ultimately to inform the 
decision-making around our future climate. We see also here the work of Clint Dawson in building a digital twin
of a coastal area, here, the Gulf Coast, again combining powerful physics models
with all the different kinds of data and here, focused on making
storm surge modeling for hurricanes even more accurate, again, in support
of critical decision-making. And then in medicine, I think it's pretty clear
that digital twins have such a role to play in realizing the promise
of personalized medicine. Here we see some of the work
of Michael Sacks from our Oden Institute Willerson Center, in moving towards patient-specific, personalized heart care, and the work of Tom Yankeelov
and David Hellmuth, also in the Oden Institute, also working with Dell Medical School
and part of biomedical engineering, in building digital twins
for cancer patients. So I hope that helps to, as I said, provoke your imaginations to think
about what might be possible. I personally could not be more excited about a future world where digital
twins are enabling safer, more efficient engineering systems. They're enabling a better understanding
of the natural world around us and they're enabling
better medical outcomes for all of us as an individual. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #business #Peru","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'business', 'education', 'health care', 'community', 'public health', 'South America', 'infrastructure', 'Carlos Rodríguez Pastor']",2023-10-06T05:41:22-07:00,2023-10-06T05:41:22-07:00,People & Blogs,"Corey Hajim: I'm so excited
to be here today with Carlos. He's a leader I really admire, because he uses his business acumen
to take on big challenges, and he's done so in his home country
of Peru and beyond. He has built a group
of affordable schools called Innova, and they serve about 65,000 students. He also has a chain
of maternity health-care clinics, he's taken on infrastructure projects
and public-private partnerships, among other things. Now I have to tell you, it's taken me a couple of years
to convince Carlos to come speak with us here at TED. He's not really a spotlight guy. You're more likely to find him
doing deep research, ""Undercover Boss"" style, than talking about his work
in the glossy pages of business magazines. Not that he doesn't deserve
to be there -- he really does. And so we're so lucky
to have him here with us today to tell us more about 
what he’s done, how he’s done it and what we can learn from it. So thanks for being here, Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor:
Thanks, Corey, glad to be here. (Applause) CH: Let's start with education.
What was the problem you saw there? CRP: So let me just put it in context
and tell you a little bit about Peru. Peru is a middle-income country. It's right in the middle
of South America, on the Pacific Coast. And from 1990 to 2017, we grew our economy close to five percent, so it's one of the fastest-growing
economies in the world, and certainly the fastest
in South America. At the same time, the poverty rate came down
from 55 percent to 25 percent. So we were feeling pretty good about all the things
that were going on in Peru, and it seemed like there was
a possibility that eventually, 25 years from now, we could become a developed country. But there are a lot
of hurdles along the way that we have to overcome
in order to get there. And some of them include the basic things
that happen in most developing countries, like education,
health care, infrastructure. Now during the same time,
I remember, in about 2007, they did an assessment
of all the public school teachers, and the results were not very encouraging. A very small percentage passed basic math,
basic reading comprehension. And in the year 2000, we were ranked last in the PISA rankings, which are these rankings
for 15-year-old kids in various countries. And 12 years later,
we were also dead last. So despite all this growth, we had a real issue,
to improve our education system. And so we decided to get involved, to understand what was going on, because it was obvious that we could not
become a developed country without having world-class 
education and health care. CH: And you said that the public schools
were in rough shape. We wanted to share a photo
of the state of the public schools. And you were saying
it's not just the way it looks, it was what was going on inside. CRP: So this is a typical public school
we saw when we started our research. You can see it kind of looks dark outside, but what's worse
is what's going on inside. Kids aren't learning. Low attendance,
low engagement and poor quality. And as a result of these public schools, a lot of small, informal private schools
started popping up all over the country. And they were just as bad
as some of the public schools. And they have catchy names, right? (Laughter) CRP: And here's another one
with a catchy name. (Laughter) CH: Some of you may have gone there. (Laughter) CRP: And so when we did
our ""Undercover Boss"" research, we went to one of these schools. I remember going
with a couple of colleagues and asking a lot of questions
to the person who gave us the tour. She didn't believe that we were parents with kids looking to go
into those schools. She was getting suspicious
and asked us to please leave, because she was the director
and also the owner. And before we left,
we asked her one final question, and that is ""Why did you decide
to do a private school?"" And her answer surprised us. She said, ""Because it's more profitable
than a Chinese food restaurant."" Now, sadly, this is the level
of commitment in a lot of these private schools. So we decided it's time
to do something about this. CH: Not quite the right motivation. Education is so complicated, so when you started this journey,
what were your goals? CRP: I didn't know anything
about education, except from being a student
and a consumer of it for many years, so the first thing I did --
and this is a true story -- I watched every TED Talk on education. CH: I promise, it's not a plant. CRP: And then started reaching out to the different people
I thought were interesting, and were doing wonderful things there. I grew up partly in California,
I worked on Wall Street, so I started looking at my contact list, and I remembered an innovation company
that, when I grew up in California, was always behind a lot
of the product innovation. So I called them up, IDEO. And with them, along with Sal Khan,
who we were introduced with, and some academics
from Berkeley and from Harvard, we put together a system to really try
to change education in our country. So in Peru, we have
eight million K-12 kids, and our target was about
1.6 million of those kids over time, which we call the emerging middle class. And what we codesigned was a system that had
four characteristics. The first one, it had to be affordable. And by affordable, I mean 150 dollars a month
for the regular students, and for our scholarship students,
one dollar a day. Second, it had to have
academic excellence. These are schools
that have to move the needle. Otherwise, it doesn't really make sense. And they're well-designed,
they were modern, they were safe. Third, we wanted
a project that was scalable. Not just to build one or two schools, but why not aspire to build
hundreds of schools, and perhaps cross borders
and go to other countries. And fourth, we thought
it was very important that the schools be sustainable. And ""sustainable"" is our code word
for ""profitable."" CH: So profitability,
let's talk a little bit about that. Why is that so important? Because we talked about the woman
and the Chinese restaurant and that she didn't seem
properly motivated. So why, for you,
is profitability so important? CRP: I think it's very important, because that way,
we can keep building more schools and we can go across borders
and keep this project going. You know, it's very ambitious
for the teachers, so I imagine someday,
in some neighboring country, you know, a mom and dad having a conversation
about where to send their kids to school, and maybe one of the parents says, ""What about that school
where the Peruvians are teaching?"" So imagine that, going from last in education in the world to being the teachers of our region. That would do so much
to the self-esteem of our country, Peru. CH: That goes back
to what you said about sustainability: profitability, for you,
equals sustainability. There must be some trade-offs
that you're making to make these schools reach profitability. What are some of those trade-offs? CRP: When you start with a fixed price
that you can charge, you can't do everything. So sometimes, our students
have to share tablets, we don't have swimming pools, but we have very nice spaces where kids can learn,
they can collaborate. We use a blended learning model, which is solo learning
and classroom learning. This is an image of one of our schools, and the next is an image
of our rock-star math teacher, in middle school, Sal Khan. It's a funny story -- when Sal came to visit us
in Peru many years ago, when we were just starting out, he came to our math lab, where we have 60 kids and one monitor, looking and helping
the kids that need help. I was talking to Sal
and a couple of other people with him. As you know, he never appears
in his videos, it's just his voice. And one of the young kids said,
""Hey, that sounds like Sal Khan. Is that Sal?"" And before you knew it, word got around, and a huge line of kids
asking Sal for his autograph. You know, their math teacher. (Applause) CH: It’s a really wonderful story,
a nice rock star to have stop by. So let’s shift gears a little
towards healthcare. What did you want to do there,
and what have you done in that space? CRP: Healthcare was as broken
as the education system. Maybe the slight difference
is in education, you have to have
a real sense of urgency -- otherwise, you miss the entire generation. And in healthcare, we are fairly lucky that we still have
a young population, so perhaps we have a little more time
to go through this. But, you know, our healthcare system
is universal healthcare. Eight million informal workers
have that from the government, and then four million pay a tax
of the formal economy, that's slightly better, but this is a typical picture. You make a long line. Sometimes, it's hours. There’s a lot of informal ... 
just like the private schools, and they'll offer two-for-one
medical procedures ... CH: Bring a friend? CRP: Exactly. 
It’s not good quality. So again, we teamed up with IDEO and a lot of different institutions to design something
for the emerging middle class. The first call in Peru is pharmacies. So if you're sick,
you go to the pharmacy first, because you'd waste a whole day, and you really can't afford
to leave work for a day. So right around the time
we started Innova, we got involved in buying
a small chain of pharmacies that today has 2,300 locations
throughout the entire country, including the most remote areas
you can imagine, in the Amazon, where you have to go
in canoes and ships to get there. And as an extension of that, we also developed a clinic called Aviva, where we give good quality, about 40 to 60 beds
in each one of our clinics, and we're focusing
on the most important part of life, which is birth. This particular clinic in Lima had the most births
of the entire country last year. And so now, we have an alternative to give good health care
to the emerging middle class. CH: Now another thing
you've dipped your toe into, in pretty big ways -- infrastructure, and that's a whole
different kind of project. And you did it through
a public-private partnership. Can you talk a little bit
about how that came about and how it worked? CRP: So years ago,
I remember going to Arequipa, which is the second-largest city in Peru, with my father and my grandfather. And in that visit, hearing about a bridge
that was going to be built. Years later, I went back, and I heard about the bridge again. And it turns out that this bridge
has been on the planning board for over 50 years, and it never got done. It was because this party was in power,
whatever the reason, it just didn't get done. So a few years ago, the government came up
with a very clever plan. It's called ""Projects for Taxes."" And what that does is it allows companies
to use up to 30 percent of the taxes they pay -- instead of paying it
to the central government, to use it for projects
that the community needs. They have to be pre-approved ... 
by the government, but then you kind of do it yourself. So we teamed up with the largest
beer company in Peru and one of the large
mining companies, and together, we put 100 million dollars of the taxes we would have paid
to the central government, and we built this bridge, which connects one side
of the city to the other. It was done on time and on budget. No corruption, no drama, the bridge is still standing. (Laughter) And now, you know, thousands of people
every single day use this bridge and, as a result,
improve the quality of their life. This is a very good example of how private-public
partnerships can work. And what we've done in our group is we've set a goal
to have an iconic project, like that bridge you just saw, in every one of the 25 states across Peru. So far, we've completed five,
in five different states, so we have 20 to go, but we're excited about that. CH: When I read about that, I thought that was such
an interesting project and an interesting partnership. So a lot of the businesses
you've started and your projects are focused on the middle class. So why are you so focused on that particular segment
of the population? CRP: The middle class,
for the last couple of decades, has been the fastest-growing
segment of the country. It was, in a way, low-hanging fruit. A lot of services were unmet, and so we tried to develop
answers for those. And it was also a way to scale fast, because a lot of the emerging middle class
is in urban settings. So you can actually go
from zero to relevance relatively fast. What we're working on now
is what we call the next frontier, which is rural Peru, which is still a big part
of the population, and all the cities in our country
that have 20,000 or less people. But really, the reason we got involved
in areas like education and healthcare is that the government wasn't delivering. If you're familiar with Peru,
and you know what's been going on, we've had six presidents in six years. Now the last president
before the current one had so many cabinet changes
that on average, every five days, we'd have
a new cabinet minister. So ask yourself,
if you're running an organization ... You can't get even through the weekend. Maybe Monday, he's here,
Friday, they're gone. So it's very hard
to get things accomplished from the government side. So what should we do? Should we wait for that Batman
president to show up? Or should we get involved? And I have to admit that for many years, I would attend conferences
and would do what a lot of people do, the golf clap, and then go back to your work, and say, ""I'd like to help, but ..."" And then the next year, another golf clap, and, kind of, the same thing. But we really believe that the private sector
has a very important role. It's 80 percent
of the economy in our country. And we can really push the leaders along to take on the most difficult,
most challenging problems in the country. Because education takes
20, 25 years or more to solve. A political term may be
only four or five years. So I think we have more staying power. And we don't pretend to run
the whole education system or to educate the eight million kids
that go to schools. But if we do our job correctly, maybe we can put it up
at the top of the agenda, maybe we can show how it can be done. We can continue to partner
with the government, and together, as a result,
make a better country. CH: I mean, a lot
of the things you've done, you've stepped in where government
has fallen short. Do you feel like you're letting them
off the hook, though? Or do you feel they're responding to this? CRP: I would say it's the opposite. We're putting pressure
to get these things resolved. I believe that,
by showing what can be done, perhaps we can inspire them
to work together, not just with us, but with all the other
fine companies that we have in our country that do world-class things. But we can't just fold our hands and wait, in the hope that a savior
someday comes and helps us. And I think that's what's behind
all these projects. CH: There was one more picture
you wanted me to share with the audience, of the protests in Peru. Why did you want me
to share this with them? CRP: This is a horrible picture. It's horrible for a number of reasons -- it hurts our tourism,
and the image of the country, etc. But what makes me really sad
about this picture -- and this happened not too long ago,
a few weeks ago -- is it's Peruvians against Peruvians. And I think we both want the same things. We want a better life,
we want opportunity. We want the ability to reach our dreams and go as far as we can go. And when I see this, I wonder, is this just Peru? Or can this happen in other communities? And how can we stop this from happening? So I have some suggestions. The first one is find out what are
the most difficult challenges in your community and your country, and try to understand them. Get involved. Put a sense of urgency, raise your hand. Not some day. Make ""some day"" today. Second is seek out help. Most likely, the problems have been
solved somewhere else. And you can add to that
and continue to build. And the last thing is have a mindset where you're trying
to make the pie bigger. And even if you come
from the private sector, I guarantee you, if you focus on making the pie
bigger for your country, you'll do well yourself. Our objective is to make Peru the best place to raise a family
in Latin America. Our long-term objective is to push Peru
to become a developed country. And that's really hard. And then, it comes to execution. And this is where we lose
a lot of that impetus, a lot of that ""let's get it done,""
because it's hard. And what we found out is that,
when you have a big challenge, many times, you'll say ""yes, but."" And that ""but"" is followed
by lots and lots of excuses. In Spanish, it's ""sí, pero."" ""Pero"" is the ""but."" So we decided to make it a little easier. And why not change that ""o"" to a ""u,"" and wake up every morning,
and say ""sí, Perú."" (Laughter) (Applause) CH: Well, I think you can see
why I admire this guy. (Laughs) Thank you so much, Carlos,
for all that you've shared with us. I think we all have a lot of work to do,
so thank you. CRP: Thank you, Corey. (Applause) (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #work","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'business', 'work', 'motivation', 'TEDx', 'worklife']",2023-10-27T04:00:14-07:00,2023-10-27T04:00:14-07:00,Science & Technology,"In 2014, KPMG's leadership had a problem. Accounting is boring. Apologies to any accountants in the room, but that really was the issue. The senior leadership of one
of the world's premier accounting firms had been working for a while
to improve morale and engagement across the nearly 30,000
employees of the firm. When they started,
morale was in the tank. Only about half of employees
had a favorable opinion of the firm when surveyed, which is to say about half of employees had an unfavorable opinion of the place
they continued to work. They had tried to pull
the standard levers, perks, pay increases, more flexibility, more
opportunities to advance. But their initial gains had leveled off. And it's easy to understand why. Accounting, in particular auditing, can be a boring and thankless job. For most of the day, you're staring
at documents and spreadsheets, you're sitting in a cubicle
provided by a client who doesn't actually want you there and doesn't want to answer
any more questions either. And so having run out
of traditional ideas, KPMG's leaders decided
to do something different. They decided to put purpose
at the core of their engagement effort. And what they did first
was particularly bold. They told stories. They launched what they called
the We Shape History campaign, a promotional campaign
designed to tell the story of how KPMG had been involved
in pivotal moments in world history. They told the story of President
Roosevelt’s Lend-Lease Act, which sent billions of dollars in aid
to the Allies during World War II, and how he tapped KPMG
to manage logistics. They told the story of how KPMG accountants
resolved conflicting financial claims, which laid the groundwork for the release of 52 US hostages in Iran in 1981. They told the story of how KPMG
certified the election of Nelson Mandela in South Africa in 1994. They told stories about how KPMG's
work served a higher purpose and they hung posters everywhere
to remind everyone of those stories. It was bold and it worked. Sort of. It moved the needle a little bit. What they did next was brilliant. To understand why their next move
was so brilliant, though, we need to talk about purpose. See, most of us think
of an organization's purpose or mission as a bold and lofty ambition, like, helping win a world war
or certify a historic election. And most leaders think that to convey
a purpose that truly inspires, they need a compelling answer
to the question, “why?” As in, why do we do what we do? And this is where it gets weird because then most leaders look
to their mission statement. And even though mission
is different than purpose, but that's a totally different talk. They look at their mission statement, they work to rewrite it
to make it more compelling. They go through rounds and rounds
of editing and focus-group testing, and when their heavily workshopped,
perfectly worded statement is complete, they send it out to employees
in emails that get deleted. They print it on posters that get ignored. They put it on a page
on the company website that no one visits. Because it turns out, most people are less inspired
by a compelling answer to “why” and more motivated by a clear answer
to the question, “who?” As in, who is served
by the work that we do? I mean, think about yourself. If I asked you to think of a time
when you felt highly engaged and inspired at work, you probably wouldn't mention the time your boss recited the company
mission statement verbatim. Instead, you'd probably think
of the last time you got a ""thank you"" from a client or a coworker, the last time you felt your work
was important to someone else. To explain this further,
let's switch cubicles. Let's move from the cubicles
of auditors at an accounting firm to the cubicles of student workers
at a university donation call center. You thought accounting was boring. Maybe you got called by one
of these student workers in one of these call centers. They call in the evenings. They always have
a perfectly worded script. It always ends in a request
for a donation. So you end up having to say, ""No, I don't want to donate
1,000 dollars to the new stadium."" ""No, I don't want to donate
500 dollars to the new student union."" ""No, I don't want to donate
20 dollars and five cents to commemorate my graduation year."" It's like some collegiate version
of ""Green Eggs and Ham."" ""No, I don't want to donate
in a box or with a fox."" ""No, I don't want to donate
in a house with a mouse."" ""Kid, I don't want
to donate here or there,"" ""Kid, I'm just trying to pay
off my student loans ..."" (Laughter) ""And then you can call me back
about donating."" Think about the person
on the other end of that line. They're sitting in a windowless room, they're constantly dialing people
destined to hang up on them, yell at them, or worse. It's got to be boring. It's got to be thankless. It's got to be draining. And you can see it in the numbers. Annual turnover in these types
of call center jobs exceeds 400 percent. You do the math on that,
that means that in any given year, the entire staff quits every three months. In fact, when Adam Grant and a team
of researchers were looking for ways to improve morale at a call center
at their university, one of the first things they noticed
was a sign in one student's cubicle. It read, ""Doing a good job here is like wetting your pants
in a dark suit."" (Laughter) ""You get a warm feeling ..."" (Laughter) ""but no one else notices."" (Laughter) The researchers wanted
them to feel noticed, obviously not for wetting themselves. They wondered if they could get
the student workers to notice the difference they were making and if that would have
a positive effect on them. So they took the break time
that these workers received and they used it to run an experiment. Some of the workers,
during one of the breaks, got to meet with a student who had received scholarship funds
raised by that call center. And they got to hear
how receiving those funds had made a positive impact on them. They got to meet their answer
to the question ""who is served by the work that we do?"" And when the researchers
followed up a month later, that little meeting had a big
impact on the workers. The workers who got to meet someone
who directly benefited from the work they were doing, they worked twice as hard. They made double the number
of calls per hour, they spent double the number
of minutes on the phone. Their weekly revenue went from
an average of 400 dollars to more than 2,000 dollars in donations. I mean, it's impossible to overstate
how big this effect is. These workers, they didn't get
any additional perks or benefits. They didn't get any additional training. They certainly didn't get asked
to memorize and internalize the university's mission statement. Instead, they got a five-minute chat with someone whose life was made
better by the work they were doing. The researchers argued
that these workers were inspired by a sense of pro-social motivation, the desire to protect and promote
the well-being of others. And that word, pro-social, that points to what's wrong
with most organizations' attempts at talking purpose. When you're talking about growth
or shareholder value or disruption or even sustainability, it becomes awfully hard
to tell specific stories about specific people
whose life is made better by the work that you're doing. But pro-social purpose
is what we want from our work. And it's what powered the second step
of KPMG's purpose initiative. After the promotional campaign, after the corporate propaganda
of the We Shape History campaign, the leaders launched what they called
the 10,000 Stories Challenge. In essence, they said to their people, ""You've heard how we've made
a difference in the past. Now you tell us how you're making
a difference right now."" They set up an online application
that not only captured individual answers, but let people design
their own version of the poster like the one from
the We Shaped History campaign. And the answers started rolling in. Answers like, ""I combat terrorism because I help banks
prevent money laundering that can go toward terrorist groups."" Or, “I help farmers grow because I support the farm credit system
that keeps family farms in business."" Or, “I restore neighborhoods because I audit
community development programs that revitalize low-income communities."" They wanted 10,000 stories. They got 42,000 stories. And in time they also got
massive increases in morale and engagement across the whole company. But it's important to emphasize why
they got such a profound response. They got 42,000 stories because they stopped talking
about purpose as a collective why, and started talking about it
as an individual who. They didn’t give every employee
a uniform answer to the question, “Why do we do what we do?” They helped each employee find
a specific answer to the question, “Who is served by the work that we do?” And just like in the call-center research, that switch made
all the difference in the world. So what does this mean for you? Well, if you're in a leadership role, it means part of your job
is to become chief storytelling officer, always ready to tell the story
of the client or coworker or community member
whose life is made better by the work your team does. And if you're not in a leadership role, you can still motivate yourself
and other people by capturing every instance
that you come across, every time you hear about someone who’s served by the work
that you’re doing. Every thank you that you get, capture it, save it for when you or anyone else
needs a powerful story about how the work
that we're doing matters. Because in the end, that's what
we all want from our work, isn't it? People want to do work that matters, and they want to work for leaders
who tell them they matter. And the most powerful way to tell them isn't to tell them some grandiose answer to “Why do we do what we do?” In fact, it isn't to tell them
anything at all. It's to help them find the answer
to the question ""Who?"" So let me ask you, do you know? Who is served by the work that you do? Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #philanthropy","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'global issues', 'business', 'future', 'philanthropy', 'money', 'Natalie Cargill']",2023-09-18T13:00:12-07:00,2023-09-18T13:00:12-07:00,Science & Technology,"I'd like to start with a true anecdote, which is that my friends
have genuinely asked me to stop sharing facts about wheat
to our group chat. I know, what’s wrong with them?
They must be mad. But to be fair to them, they have been hearing
a lot lately about wheat, wheat-related innovation, how it was funded by philanthropists, and how it might have saved
a billion lives. So I'd love to share
this story with you now as I’m here to talk about the huge and I think still largely
hidden potential of philanthropy to completely transform our world. After World War II, the global population shot up and it really wasn't clear how
we were going to grow enough food to feed everybody. In lots of places, the soil
was completely depleted of nutrients, lots of the crops that did grow
were destroyed by disease and the situation got really bad. By the 1960s, scientists were saying
mass famine is inevitable. Millions of people might die. However, what they failed
to fully take into account was the fact that decades before this, philanthropists had already
started funding research into how we could improve crop yields
in really difficult conditions. The team was led by this man,
Norman Borlaug, and he worked in collaboration
with the Mexican government. They made some really
incredible innovations. So first they made the wheat grains
about three times bigger, which was amazing
because they were massive. It wasn't perfect, however,
because they kind of fell over. They then made the stems of the wheat
much shorter and stronger, which was ideal because they were
massive and didn't fall over. Great situation to be in. So after much of what I now call
wheat-related YMCA, the team were able
to develop really robust, disease-resistant and incredibly
high-yield crops. This new way of doing things
spread throughout the entire world and the results were quite
literally miraculous. Entire countries came back
from the brink of famine. Global cereal production as a whole
tripled in just 50 years. And our friend Norman was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. I really love this story. Not because it was the foolproof
solution to global hunger, because of course it wasn’t, and actually it was fraught
with problems of its own, but because it demonstrates
two really important ideas that I think we're neglecting to apply
to improving the world today. One, it's pretty simple. Huge problems can be solved with the right amount
of investment and cooperation. The second is that philanthropy at its best is one of the most
transformative tools we have to bring about that improvement. Now, I say at its best, because I imagine you all know
about philanthropy at its worst. At its worst, it can be
little more than a tool in the hands of the ultra wealthy to manage their own status
or their own power. It can have very little regard
for what's actually needed or what actually works. Philanthropy at its best, however, is still one of the most
powerful tools we have, especially when it can step in and do the things
that governments can't do and markets won't do. And this is exactly what happened
with Norman and the Green Revolution. Philanthropic funding
to the tune of 100,000 dollars a year from the Rockefeller
Foundation in the '40s in combination with government support, was what we needed
to get the project going. If we'd had to wait for governments
to take on all of that research and all of the funding, bearing in mind that governments
tend to move slowly and bearing in mind
that extremely poor governments don't tend to have an extremely
large amount of money, we might have been waiting
for a really long time. Similarly, if we'd had to wait
for private sector investors to take on all that risk themselves, bearing in mind they probably thought they had more profitable
things to be doing, we also might have been
waiting a really long time. Philanthropy was the thing
that could come in, speed things up and maybe
save millions of lives. And the final incredible fact
about this story is I had a really, really hard time
choosing to tell it to you today, because history is full of these hidden
philanthropic success stories. For example, I could have equally told you
about the pioneering suffragette and philanthropist Katharine McCormick, who single-handedly funded the development
of the contraceptive pill. I could have told you about how
80 million Americans came together to fund the eradication of polio, or about how just two foundations
funded conferences at the end of the Cold War that dramatically reduced
the nuclear stockpile. So bearing in mind
what we can take from all of this are simple ideas:
huge problems can be solved, philanthropy can be transformative. I'd like to invite all of you here today to go through a thought
experiment with me. And as I say, it's my favorite
type of experiment because it's just really cheap to fund. OK, thought experiment is this. We're all philanthropists. We want to bring about
transformative change, maybe even on the scale
of the Green Revolution. To do this, we want to start by tackling
some of our largest and most solvable and our most neglected
problems of all time. And I want you to, if you can,
imagine something really crazy. We actually have a massive
pile of cash to do this with. I know. Now, you might be thinking
the eternal question, where are we going to get
a massive pile of cash? And I agree, you know, you rarely
find them lying around anymore, sadly. But I do have a proposal. The one percent. If everyone in the global
top one percent of earners gave away just 10 percent of their income, or if they are particularly wealthy and this would be more money, gave away just 2.5 percent
of their net worth, we would have an additional
3.5 trillion dollars to improve the world. Now, this is a good number. It's a decent amount of money, I agree. OK, this is 3.5 trillion over and above the one trillion
that already goes to charity. And -- this is a surprising bit -- if you're earning over
60,000 dollars a year after tax, assuming you're a single person
bringing that home after tax, you are in the global one percent. This is not to say that everyone
bringing home 60K can afford to give away 10 percent because I absolutely see
that is not the case. However, it is to say that global
inequality is really, really extreme. OK, and as a final note, yes,
this is just a made-up thought experiment, but I think it can shine a real light
on what we can do in monetary terms, what it would take to solve some
of our real problems in the real world. So everything I'm about to share is the result of extremely real research
by experts at places like the World Bank, the United Nations and my co-founder
Simran Dhaliwal is here tonight, our own much smaller non-profit,
Longview Philanthropy. So, what could we do with one year
of the one percent giving 10 percent? Let's find out. For 260 billion dollars, we could ensure that nobody lives below
the extreme poverty line for the year. That line is incredibly low. It's 2.15 dollars a day and one in 12 people
currently live below that line. One solution to this is really
simple and really effective. In fact, it's so simple,
people are sometimes confused by it. Why don't we give money directly
to the poorest people in the world? There's a very conveniently named
organization that does this called GiveDirectly. Over 300 studies have been done
on this type of cash transfer, and the studies show that this works. And it works because fundamentally
people know what they need, particularly when they're extremely poor. Like Bahati, for example. With her transfer, she bought
a tank to store rainwater, livestock and her first mattress. And the fact that people
know what they need is also the reason that cash
transfers often do more to boost education than building schools. They often do more to support
businesses than business training and they often do more
to improve nutrition than all kinds of food programs. People don't need to be ""taught to fish."" We need to end that meme now. People are capable
of fishing and investing and a whole lot else once they're not trapped
in completely debilitating poverty. (Applause) For 300 billion dollars we could massively reduce the risk
of the next pandemic. And honestly, what concerns me is that the next one
is going to be even worse. And the reason is this. It's currently possible for somebody with the right type
of experience in bioengineering to go on the internet,
to order the DNA necessary to reconstruct the smallpox virus -- and as you'll know, smallpox is a horrendous disease
that we've eradicated -- to reconstruct that virus and to release it into the world. This is not some wild
conjecture or some theory. This is what scientists
are warning us about and what studies on similar viruses
are showing could be possible now. We are not prepared for this. We're not even prepared
for the next natural pandemic. Here are some things we could do. First, we could set up a screening program
to track sewage and wastewater for the early signs
of the next potential pandemic. Then we could upgrade
existing lab facilities worldwide to ensure that anyone
who needs a new vaccine can get it within six months. Then we stockpile enough
super effective super PPE to cover every single essential
worker in the world, not just people in rich countries. And we can also invest into research, into germicidal light
and other technologies that could literally
kill viruses in the air before we breathe them in. It's really early days, but a breakthrough here could mean
the end of airborne disease. For 840 billion dollars we can double what we spend
on clean energy research and development and really speed up progress
to end climate change. Clean energy R and D
has been so effective so far. Over the last 10 years, the price of wind energy
is down by 50 percent and the price of solar energy
is down by an incredible 90 percent. One thing we can do now is build on this
and start a clean energy sprint. So yes, wind and yes, solar, but also nuclear, also geothermal. Also better ways of storing
the energy we do create and better ways of removing
existing carbon from the air, particularly right at the point
where it's emitted. For now, very minuscule-looking,
mere two billion dollars, an investment here, an endowment here, could permanently quadruple
philanthropic spending to reduce nuclear risk. That is less per year
than what we spend on novelty socks. (Laughter) Nuclear risk is almost
the highest it's ever been. Right now, thousands of warheads, each capable of killing hundreds
of thousands of people, are set on high alert. We know that the early warning systems
that should alert us to incoming attacks have a massive history of false alarms, which creates a huge risk
of an accidental nuclear strike. And we know in the event
a potential strike is incoming, the US president would have
just 15 minutes to decide how to respond. And we know that the US has actually
really good early warning systems, comparatively speaking. This situation is absolutely insane. Even if you think that living in a world
without nukes is not feasible or not even desirable, there are safer ways to live
in a world with nukes than this. And because this is such a neglected area, even a tiny amount of philanthropic
funding would go a really long way to getting the better policies we need. (Applause) Thank you. For one billion dollars we could increase tenfold
the philanthropic money going towards AI safety. Bit of light relief
because you're about to need it, that's less per year than
what we spend on toys for pets. This little one here is actually my dog and I think I'm quite a decent
chunk of that one billion, if I'm honest. (Laughter) So, as you know, top AI labs around the world are currently
deliberately trying to create AI systems that are smarter than humans
at everything humans do and then some and then some,
because it won't stop there. They're funded by tech money
from the likes of Google and Microsoft, and most AI researchers think
that in the coming years or decades, they're going to succeed. What's going to happen then? We don't know. Which is terrifying because even with the relatively
simple systems we have today, like ChatGPT, companies didn't know how they were
going to behave in the real world until they've released them publicly
onto the internet. And yes, they've done
some brilliantly helpful things, but they've also done some
much less brilliantly helpful things like threaten to kill people, threaten to hack into people's emails
and blackmail them. Now, fortunately, ChatGPT
is not an existential risk. But as these systems rapidly become
more and more powerful, this way of doing things
is going to rapidly become more and more deeply unsafe. We need to put pressure
on these companies to slow down, and when the time is right,
to maybe even stop. OK. So we have quite a lot of our budget left. Let’s speed things up
and see what we can do not just to survive this century,
but to thrive in it. We could fund a 13-year plan to ensure that everybody
has access to clean water and sanitation once and for all. We could provide
the additional funding needed to make sure that hunger and malnutrition
are gone within a decade. We could give women control
over their reproductive health and fund free contraceptive -- (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Free contraceptive, maternal
and newborn care for every woman who needs it
for at least five years. We could fund the plan to end
factory farming entirely by 2050. We could massively suppress
or even eradicate the 20 neglected tropical diseases, which tend to affect
the poorest billion in the world and tend to be incredibly
cheap and easy to treat. And we could massively suppress or even
eradicate malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) We're not doomed. We don't need to resign
ourselves or our loved ones or our fellow humans or future generations to unnecessary and avoidable suffering, because we really can solve
our biggest problems. And we don't need to throw away
one of the most powerful tools we have to solve them, because philanthropy really
can be transformative. And I think the thing to remember is that everything
I've gone through today, it's not a complete list
of the world's problems. It is one option for what we could do
with one year's worth of funding from the one percent
giving just 10 percent. Imagine what we could do in year two. Thank you. (Applause and cheers) Anna Verghese: Alright. There is so much to get excited about. So you did reference
the people earning 60K, maybe it's not as realistic
to imagine committing 10 percent, but I love to turn a thought experiment
or an idea into actions. So how do we get even close
to that 3.1 trillion number? What do you think we need to do? Natalie Cargill: First of all,
to reiterate that, it's not practical, and there shouldn't be an exercise in,
you know, making people feel guilty or that they should do things
they can't afford. I think two things really help
in terms of increasing donations. One is just information
on global inequality. I think people think of the one percent
in terms of rich countries and just being aware that what’s not
extravagantly wealthy in rich countries is actually very wealthy in global terms. And I think the second thing is having
options and having information. I think a lot of people, most people
are incredibly generous and do want to improve the world, but it's not easy to navigate
all the different options. And so one thing we try and do is just share this information
as widely as we can. AV: So talk about information. You mentioned GiveDirectly
as a great organization. They're an Audacious grantee
that we gave money to during the COVID pandemic and highly endorse
sending your money that way. Are there any other ideas, organizations that you have researched
that people can get access to? NC: Yes. Seconding GiveDirectly is amazing. I think for people giving, considering that something of a benchmark
can be really helpful. Another organization I'd really recommend
people check out is called GiveWell. So they're not a charity themselves. They evaluate all kinds
of global health interventions to see which ones
are kind of the best recipients, if you're interested in global
health and development. Also, if you go to longview.org/pledge, you can see all of the research
that we we put together for this talk and for each area we break down
where we've got the estimate from and where you can donate
if you're interested. AV: Wonderful, thank you Natalie. NC: Thank you all so much. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #lovestory","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'global issues', 'science', 'sustainability', 'energy', 'countdown', 'renewable energy', 'Olivia Breese']",2023-08-23T08:31:38-07:00,2023-08-23T08:31:38-07:00,Science & Technology,"The economic cost alone
of the loss of nature and biodiversity arising out of the unabated release
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is estimated at about 44 trillion dollars. We need to reimagine
the way the world produces, consumes and prices energy, and we need to do it now. And so I'm here to tell you a love story. The lovers in this story
might seem mismatched, but their love has the power
to change the world by reimagining the global energy system. It's a story we all need to understand. A story with a complicated meet cute, but ultimately a simple resolution. It's the story of an electron
and a water molecule. Now in order to truly empathize
with my electron's narrative arc, you need to know a bit about her, her history, her personality. Electrons have powered the modern world
since the 19th century, when scientists discovered
that using magnets and coils of wire, they could turn a flow of motion
into electrons carrying energy. That was just the beginning
of our increasingly electrified existence. Behind almost everything we do, there are supply chains,
refrigeration systems, data centers and much, much more. And so it's perhaps not surprising that the global production
of electricity alone constitutes about 28 percent
of total emissions of carbon dioxide, because for much of that time, electricity has been produced
by burning fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide as a byproduct. But not our heroine. She's a green electron. Her energy comes from the sun,
the wind, the tide. An unlimited renewable resource which produces electricity
without emitting any carbon dioxide. And there is good news here. The share of green electrons
in the global electricity system is approximately 30 percent, and it's rising rapidly. So in that case, addressing climate change should be easy. We just need to electrify everything and make sure that we have enough
green electrons like her to power it. No. I identify very strongly
with the green electron, perhaps because I've spent
virtually all my professional life working to deliver her
at the greatest possible volume and the lowest possible cost. But our green electron
can't save the world on her own. And that's why this is a love story
and not a coming-of-age narrative. (Laughter) (Applause) Electrons can't save the world alone. Yep. The world also needs molecules. Now I think of molecules,
if not as exactly opposite to electrons, certainly as complementary. If I were to ascribe
a personality to a molecule, it would be consistent, reliable, self-contained. Unlike electrons, molecules are excellent at storing
and releasing energy efficiently. They're critical for industrial processes which need the intense heat
which comes from burning of fuel. They're essential for long-distance
shipping and aviation, which need to store, transport
and release energy efficiently. But these sectors, which are critical
to the global economy, they can't be electrified efficiently. And these hard-to-electrify sectors, they currently equate to about 30 percent
of total annual carbon dioxide emissions because virtually all their molecules
come from fossil fuels. And until recently
there wasn't a viable alternative to obtaining those molecules
from fossil fuels. And so no credible route to net zero, no possibility of reimagining
the global energy system, no world that runs
entirely on green energy. But … here enters our second lover. Our molecule of H2O. Water. Not a traditional pairing
with electricity, but as Emily Dickinson reminds us, the heart wants what it wants. (Laughter) And so our love story goes like this. The green electron
and the water molecule meet. They feel a spark. They fall in love. And from that love
is born a green molecule. A molecule which can
store and release energy without any fossil fuels getting involved. Or, if you prefer the scientific version: using electrolysis, the power of green electrons can be used
to split water into its constituent parts, oxygen and hydrogen, leaving us with hydrogen, H2. Hydrogen is an extremely flexible fuel. It can be burnt to provide energy for heat-intensive processes
like steel production. It can be synthesized
with biogenic carbon, nonfossil-based carbon, to produce methanol, and that methanol can be used
to decarbonize the chemical industry or as a fuel for long-distance shipping. That methanol can be further synthesized
into e-kerosene, jet fuel, which raises the possibility
of emissions-free long-distance aviation. Or finally, hydrogen can be synthesized
with nitrogen to produce ammonia. So now surely I'm going to tell you
that they all lived happily ever after, like all the great love stories, in a world that runs
entirely on green energy. But no. Because at the current rate of progress, of deploying, scaling up
these technologies, we are absolutely not on track to achieve
a one-and-a-half-degree pathway. But we are still writing this story. We know that industry can scale up
these breakthrough technologies very rapidly because at Ørsted, 
we’ve done this before. In 1991, we installed
the world's first offshore wind turbine, so close to shore
you could swim around it. Back then, offshore wind was expensive. It was widely considered
to be uneconomically viable. It was based on immature technology. There was a lot of doubt
about its long-term viability. But we committed to bring down costs. We optimized every component. We worked with the supply chain so that they could invest
in their manufacturing capacity. And as the European policymakers
saw that we and the industry, the progress that we were making
on cost and on efficiency, they reimagined
the European electricity system to put offshore wind
as a critical pillar of it. And the US and Asian markets -- like Japan, Korea, Taiwan
and of course China -- have followed. And now we need to take
the green molecule on the same journey, but much faster. In May, we broke ground
on Europe’s largest e-methanol plant, in northern Sweden. In 2025, when it's operational, it will produce enough green methanol to power one oceangoing container vessel. We’re already planning the next,
five to eight times the size. In the US, on the Gulf Coast
and all over the world, developers like us
are working with companies who want to defossilize their operations
to build green hydrogen projects. But the global energy system
cannot be defossilized by individuals, even those in love. Not by individual projects,
no matter their scale, not by individual companies. Even whole countries acting alone cannot transform the global energy system away from one which
is dependent on fossil fuels. Until now, the price of fossil fuels has not reflected the true cost of the unabated release
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It does not reflect the costs
of adaptation and mitigation to a changing climate. And so those costs,
they fall on all of us. Inevitably, they fall on us inequitably. And that must change. Too often, the costs of defossilization, whether of companies, cities, countries, is dismissed as too expensive. And yet, if the price of fossil fuels
reflected their true cost, the economic imperative would be
to seek out the defossilized version. The economic imperative would be to scale up these solutions
we already have at hand. A world which runs entirely
on green energy, it's not a luxury, it's a necessity. (Applause) And so to come back,
finally, to my love story. In the UK, where I'm from, there's a moment in the wedding ceremony which recognizes the importance
of communal action. It’s my favorite moment every time, because it reflects the fact
that marriage is an intensely private act. But families, families of all kinds, it's a societal endeavor, it's a product, it's a component of society, just like my love story. And so in this, the story of the electron
and the water molecule who meet, fall in love,
who produce the green electron, who has the power
to reimagine the world's energy system. I believe that they and therefore we can live happily ever after, but only, as in the marriage ceremony, only with the support
of their family and friends. In the UK, the traditional
response to the question, ""Will you support and uphold the newlyweds
now and in the years to come,"" is, ""We will."" And for our lovers? Will we? Their family and friends? Government? Industry? Society? Consumers? Voters? Will we support and uphold them? We need to. We must. We will. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #wealth","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'economics', 'social change', 'poverty', 'woman', 'humanity', 'money', 'Aisha Nyandoro']",2023-10-17T04:00:46-07:00,2023-10-17T04:00:46-07:00,Science & Technology,"Growing up in Mississippi, my family never talked about money, but I could infer how much people had
by pattern keeping at Christmas time. My uncle Chip was always good for money, an absolute delight. JCPenney's, here I come. (Laughter) Mama Adele would always
give us apples, oranges, butterscotch candy, in a brown paper bag. It was a gift given with love
and it meant a lot coming from the matriarch of our family. Now my parents, my parents would make sure my twin and I
were fresh in the latest fashions. Girbaud jeans, Starter jackets. Looking good made us feel rich,
even if we weren't. So it was interesting because I remember
having a myriad of conversations about prison reform, the education system, voter rights, but a candid conversation about money, it never happened. When I went to graduate school,
my world expanded. Hearing my friends talk
about their overseas adventures made me envious. I didn't even have a passport at the time. When I got my first job
post graduate school, I was making 70,000 dollars. I was rich. But that shopping spree at JCPenney's
was no longer going to scratch that itch. I needed to do whatever I could
to be legit wealthy. I think that’s why one of the many
Oprah Winfrey episodes that I watched [in] the early 2000s stood out to me. On this particular episode,
Suze Orman was the guest. And for those of you who don't know, Suze is an American author
and financial advisor, and she has the most perfect
white teeth I've ever seen. (Laughter) Well, Suze was talking about 401(k)s, and I got the basic gist
of what she was saying. Save a little money now,
have a lot of money in the future. Sounded great, amazing, sign me up. So I went to meet a wealth advisor,
somebody I met off the internet. I just knew that this random person
was going to unlock some magical room and give me all the tricks
I needed to be wealthy. I mean big house, fancy cars,
luxurious vacation. I was excited until I wasn't. The nondescript building in a strip mall did not boost my confidence that this was how the wealthy
managed their affairs. (Laughter) I was placed in a small white waiting room and I stayed there
for what felt like forever. Finally, a man came in
who could not even bother to learn the correct
pronunciation of my name and asked me what my goals
were for the future. OK, I'm excited again. I know the answer to this. Number one, I would like to retire
comfortably by the age of 60. Number two, I would like to be
able to take care of my mom. His response, ""I don't know why taking care
of your mother is your responsibility."" He then went on to speak
in some financial jargon I could not understand. The entire interaction took me so aback that I vowed to share the bare minimum
the rest of the meeting. I could not figure out what I was missing, but it made me question everything. Maybe I did not know what wealth was. Maybe wealth was not intended
for people like me. Maybe I was reaching for too much. So I find it funny, or maybe serendipitous that I think about cash
and wealth all the time now. For the last ten years, I've led an organization
in Jackson, Mississippi, that takes a radically community-driven
approach to supporting families, mainly Black women, that live in federally subsidized
affordable housing. Our programs are strategic and holistic. A few years ago, we became concerned that we were not
moving the needle on poverty. So we went to the women that we work with
and we said, ""What are we missing?"" The answers were all different, but the underlying problem was the same. The problem was the lack of cash. No money for pizza on a Friday night
was causing stress. Unexpected car repairs
were leading to unemployment because people could not
get to and from work. So we began to research
how do you give money, not another program, to people
experiencing poverty? In 2018, we launched
the Magnolia Mother's Trust, this country's first modern
guaranteed-income program, and the first in the world
to center its efforts on Black women. (Cheers) Thank you. (Applause) Quickly, for the uninitiated, a guaranteed income
is a specific amount of money given to a specific population
over a set amount of time. It's typically funded
by private philanthropy or in some instances, the public sector. It's not a new idea. Jenny Tillman, a mom and welfare activist, called for a guaranteed income
way back in 1972, and even Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
and President Nixon indicated that a guaranteed income
could help solve for poverty. It's not a new idea, but like I said, we are pioneers
and our efforts are working. We provide 1,000 dollars a month
for 12 months to Black mothers. And our goal is simple: to provide these women
with the breathing room they need by giving them the financial
resources they need to dream a little bigger. We provide -- Thank you. (Applause) We provide 1,000 dollars
a month for 12 months, and we have proven that 12,000 dollars is a life-altering amount of money. Yes, it allows you to take care
of the practical needs, like getting that car repaired, but it also allows you
to shift your reality. Literally, shift your reality
from scarcity to abundance, from tunneling to imagination, from scraping by to genuine opportunity. There are over 100
guaranteed income programs currently being implemented
in this country, and many were inspired by what we started in Jackson, Mississippi, of all places. Black women have ushered in
a movement and it has been beautiful, but it is just the start. Over the last few years, as I have watched more and more moms
move towards income stability, I have listened as they
have began to dream about a life free of economic stress. I have watched as they began
to dream about wealth. Now, I understand that the most
basic definition of wealth is what you own, minus what you owe. And I also know we typically define it
as having big cars, luxurious vacations, one-upping our neighbor on this
never-ending ladder of economic success. But for many women,
particularly women of color, who do not have access
or the ability to earn a living wage because of pay inequity, that definition
is meaningless or inadequate. Lord knows that we must solve
for the racial wealth gap, and it is going to take
radical imagination and a reinvention of big systems. But until then, people cannot be gaslit into believing that their definition of wealth
is invalid or less important. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Bell Hooks once wrote, ""Definitions are a vital starting point
to the imagination. What one cannot imagine
cannot come into being."" One day I was having
a conversation with Coco, a mom within the Magnolia Mother's Trust,
and I asked her, ""What is wealth to you?"" Without skipping a beat, she said, ""If anything were to happen to me, my family would have the money
to cover my burial expenses."" Asking more and more women
the same question, I have come to learn
that wealth is dignified funerals, the privilege of privacy, the ability to complete school,
own a business, or the thrill of being
the extravagant auntie. All of these are definitions
of wealth to them. Wealth is about a sense of agency,
a sense of freedom, the collective well-being of the whole. It is not an individual
pathological pursuit. For too long, we have allowed
financial institutions to define wealth and the process
by which we build it. I have never had a mother say to me, wealth is having stocks and bonds, equity in her home,
or even a retirement account. Instead, they dream about what a life
of ease and care would look like. Another case in point. I was having a conversation
with a mom I work with, and I asked if she had
six months’ worth of savings to cover an emergency. She started laughing. She could not even see herself
in the equation that I was offering. She said that ""Before
the Magnolia Mothers Trust, I didn’t even have a savings account,
let alone one month’s worth of savings.” I said, ""OK, let me
ask the question differently. What is wealth to you?"" She said, ""Oh, that's easy. All of my bills paid every month with a little left over
for anything extra."" She knew exactly what she needed. Our narrow definition
simply did not address her needs. Hearing these responses,
time and time again, I began to realize
that we have to redefine wealth, and we actually can redefine wealth. And a way we do that
is by listening to others and then by being brave enough
to listen to ourselves. So of course, y'all, I had to ask myself, what is wealth? And I will admit to each of you all
because we're best friends now -- (Laughter) That when I first asked myself
this question, I started crying. I realized that for over 20 years, I had been holding on to a definition
that was not written for me, nor did it mirror my desires. I never wanted that big house
backed up against the lake. I simply wanted what
it represented in my mind: My ability to gather my people,
to nourish them, to spoil them, to make sure that we were
protected and cared for before we go out into the world
doing the hard work of caring for others. Please hear my words. I am not saying that women experiencing
poverty simply need space to dream. If you all walk out
of this theater with that, I am going to be very unhappy. (Laughter) What I am saying is that the space to dream mixed with cash can lead to transformation
that can lead to true wealth. It is my belief that we,
all of us in this room, are made less [wealthy] by virtue of tolerating a country
where anyone has to prove their worth. We may have 500 different
definitions of wealth, but we can all agree that we are all
degraded by normalizing immoral inequity. After all these years, I have finally -- (Applause) After all of these years, I have finally accomplished
what I set out to achieve all those years ago
with that random wealth advisor. I am emboldened and empowered
to manage my wealth and no, I don't mean money. I mean, I am a loving daughter, I am a mom who takes
their boys on vacation and you best believe
I am an extravagant auntie. (Laughter) We have a poverty of imagination
about what makes you wealthy. I mean the things that people say
about you at your funeral. I mean legacy. But here's the thing. From where I sit, we can offer
that kind of wealth to everyone. And yes, I am going to play
on the word here, I can guarantee it, if we are simply willing to understand that a small financial investment
can change someone's life, giving them the flexibility, breathing room and space to define and build wealth
on their own terms. And that may be wealth defined by equity,
love, honor and delight. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

#TED #TEDTalks #creativity","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'social change', 'art', 'creativity', 'photography', 'Internet', 'Misan Harriman']",2023-08-01T09:08:56-07:00,2023-08-01T09:08:56-07:00,People & Blogs,"There are so many strong opinions
about how bad the internet has become. How it has weaponized mediocrity. Normalized mis- and disinformation. But for me, the information superhighway
has always been my savior. As a little boy, I was sent from Nigeria to boarding school
in the English countryside. It was like ""Harry Potter""
without the magic. (Laughter) It was a confusing and troubling time for an already sensitive little boy
who was far from home. I was more like an exotic animal in a petting zoo
rather than a student. And to top it off, I'm dyslexic and today what would be described
as neurodiverse, which for me meant that the classroom
was impossibly slow and my brain was not capable
of assimilating how they were teaching me. So for a big part of my life, I was ashamed of my own mind. And if I'm being honest,
I was ashamed of myself. Luckily, the internet had other ideas. Every time I consumed something online,
my brain felt alive. It was an awakening of sorts. And luckily for me, I am the right age to have discovered
the internet in that very, very moment. So what did I start doing? I started realizing how my mind worked. How I could assimilate audiovisual
experiences intensely. How I could name a song
within the first second or the first note. Or talk about scenes in films
like I lived them. And how overwhelmingly powerful
artistic experiences were for me. This became my savior. And I wanted to share it with my friends. So pop ballads like
""More Than Words"" by Extreme. Street poetry like
“Brenda’s Got a Baby” by Tupac. Films like ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" ""Love Jones,"" and of course, ""Cinema Paradiso."" These experiences were way more
than entertainment for me. I was being raised by these experiences, and I needed to share it
with as many people as possible. So my friends would come
with their hard drives, and I would download and share pictures
and poetry and film for them. For me, the internet had become
an endless library of the extraordinary. And I didn't just have the keys
to this library. I lived there. We would talk about Fela Kuti,
Joni Mitchell, Neil Young. These were my heroes. These were the souls
that have found the blueprint of how to do and win
in this thing called life. It also saved my mental health. The dancing of Misha Baryshnikov was for me, like watching
a perfect sunset. The voice of Sarah Vaughan
was my North Star. And of course, the words of Pablo Neruda? Well, that will always be
medicine for my soul. So, how did I get to be
this great observer of content and become an artist? It was just sharing images. And one of the images I shared
all the time was this image of Coretta Scott King. This image was taken by Moneta Sleet Jr., the first Black man to win
a Pulitzer for photography. This image almost didn't happen
because unbelievably, no Black media was invited to photograph the funeral
of Dr. Martin Luther King. When Coretta Scott realized, she said, ""No one's coming into this church
if Moneta Sleet is not allowed."" And thank the heavens that he was, because it was his lens
that captured the grace and somehow, on an unimaginable day, the strength of Coretta Scott King on the funeral of her husband
with her baby girl, Bernice, in her lap. It was this image that taught me that photography can be way more
than wedding pics and birthday snaps. It was this image that let me know
that at its best, photography can let us know
the work that we need to do. (Applause) So how did I become
an actual photographer? Well, the answer of that is love. My wife. My wife. We fell in love together by feeling each other’s
invisible scars like braille. She fell in love
with all the parts of myself that I was ashamed of. She looked beyond my anxiety,
my imposter syndrome, and she saw a man that maybe
had a point of view himself. So she bought me a camera
for my 40th birthday. Just five years ago. So I have a camera now, I don't know what to do with it. And once again, I go online, and I teach myself about ISO
and aperture on YouTube. I teach myself about editing
with Adobe Lightroom on YouTube. And there's a great beauty
for someone like me to be able to fail and fail
in my little office, online, watching free tutorials. This is a gift of the internet. Everything changed
when my daughter was born. You see, the thing
about not loving yourself is that when something truly great, something celestial,
like a child, comes into your life, you tell yourself you don't deserve it. My daughter was premature, and I was terrified to be the custodian of something so beautifully precious. So I hid behind my camera. And as I kept taking pictures of this
little soul and as she got stronger, the camera and my daughter
taught me how to receive love and taught me to accept the immense grace and privilege
of being a father. This was the most important moment
in my photographic journey. Two years later, in 2020,
George Floyd was killed. And all of us saw that
because of the power of social media. And this time we refused to look away. I looked to my wife and I said,
“I have run out of tears.” And she said, ""Look to your camera."" And I took my camera
to the streets of London, not knowing if I would photograph
five people or 5,000. And I was able to observe one of the greatest civil rights
movements in our lifetime. The global protests
after the death of George Floyd is something none of us
would have expected. And my lens was there. One morning I woke up
and I couldn’t open my phone because I had so many notifications. The son of Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther King III, had somehow come across one of my images
and posted it on his Twitter. And then the world discovered me. (Applause) Millions of people saw these images
and now, unbelievably, British “Vogue” came calling, and they commissioned
a then-unknown photographer to shoot the September issue
of British ""Vogue"" 2020. And in doing so, I became
the first Black man to shoot any cover for British ""Vogue."" (Applause) It took 104 years to get to my cover. Since then, I've had
this extraordinary career photographing amazing humans,
amazing moments. But beyond all the glitz
and all the glamour, it is really important for me to recognize the intentionality and the empathy
of where my lens must look. The world is burning right now and we cannot pass each other by
like ships in the night. So my lens has to look
to where voices need to be lifted. I recently have become an ambassador
for Save the Children. And I went to Somaliland
to cover the famine, the hunger crisis
that is in the Horn of Africa. These brave people are suffering
because of climate change, something that they add very little to. Many of the children
are born into a hellscape that is not of their making. 1.6 million children
are on the verge of acute malnutrition. And I want my images to let you know that you cannot say you did not know. So I ask you to use whatever levers
of power that you have, at dinner parties, on your social media, speak to those that can do
something about it if you cannot yourself. I will finish by saying this. Do not be afraid to take
the road less traveled. Wear your vulnerability with pride. It is what makes us human. This age of perceived perfection, it's over. Very few of us are OK, and that's OK. And to the parents and teachers that are looking after children
with different minds, please let them know about the power and possibility of their minds. Because they may have the answers that will allow all of us
to look toward the horizon together. Thank you. (Applause)"

what my favorite word is? (Laughter) It's the F word. (Audience: Yeah!) Some people think it's a little dirty. Others really like to throw it around. Oh, y’all thought I meant “fuck”? (Laughter) No, no, no, no, no. My favorite word is “fandom.” This talk is about fandom and how fandom can enrich your life and build a community of people that you might not have
always talked to, right? But I'm sure when you all think of fandom, y'all think nerds and cosplay
and fan fiction and neck beards and people in dark basements and stuff. And all that is true. (Laughter) But you also probably think
about America's ass. (Laughter) I do. (Laughter and cheers) And yes, fandom is all of this stuff, but it is actually a community
of people that share a passion. Fandom is a community of people
that share a passion. Right? But like all things,
a there's a spectrum, right? You have your casual fans,
your fans, your hardcore fans, and then you have your fanatics. And it can get really ugly,
just like that ugly thing. Every time I see it, I run scared. Sorry to all my Phillies fans,
it's ugly, right? But I want to talk about the difference
between being a fan and being a fanatic, right? Fans want to bring in joy. They want to share stuff
as much as possible with you, right? Fanatics are -- And I know I watched Obi-Wan last night,
so ""Star Wars"" is on the brain -- But fanatics are those ""Star Wars"" fans that chased two grown women
off of the internet because they gave the Millennium
Falcon to a girl, right. They weren't happy about that. Those are fanatics. We want to be fans. We don't want to be fanatics, right? Because fans create worlds. Once the story is over,
once the movie is done, they want to keep it going. So they start to create cosplay,
fan fiction, video games. I mean, I myself have a lot
of feelings and fandoms, so I have a newsletter that I write
whenever I remember to write it. (Laughter) And also, because we're friends here, I cosplay. (Laughter) I'm not new to this,
I'm true to this, right. I wanted to still still engage
with all of the worlds that I love, even though the movie was over. Fans aren't gatekeepers. Y'all can clap. (Applause) We all have that friend
that watches us watch a movie because they want us to like
the same part that they like. (Laughter) That is a fan. Fanatics are those people who quiz me
when I come into a comic book store thinking because I look like this, that I can't know about comics, right? And fans learn life lessons from some
of the nerdiest places, right? So for a quick example, how many
Blazers fans are here? (Cheers and applause) Right. Y'all are really patient people, I'm sure. (Laughter) Y'all will continue to be patient. With that number seven pick,
y’all got, sucks for y’all. (Laughter) Or if you were an Oregon women's
Ducks fan, which we all should be -- (Cheers and applause) You probably understand
the importance of women in power, the value of women in sports and you're probably just
overall a much better person. (Laughter) Because fandom when harnessed is greater
than any box office number. Right, fandom when harnessed is greater
than any box office number. You meet people who you might have not
necessarily always talk to, right? You learn from so many different people and you learn a lot of things
from these things that you love so much. Whether or not you realize it, right? Think about what you put
on your locker when you were a teenager or in your three-ring binder or even on your phone
background right now. Something somewhere has inspired you or guided you along this journey
called life, right? So I'm going to give you all ten things -- I have a lot of fandoms,
I have a lot of them, but I'm going to give you ten things
that my fandoms have taught me. Number one, Storm from the ""X-Men,"" y'all should be clapping right now. (Applause and cheers) She is the leader of the X-Men. As a young Black girl seeing this tall, beautiful Black woman
with all this white hair and a very operatic voice leading the way, it was very impactful
for a Fox Kids Saturday morning. That's my son. (Applause and laughter) “Star Wars” taught me that my world
can be as big as a galaxy far, far away. Whether that is real or fake. My world can be much bigger than just
the six blocks that I call my home. Wonder Woman -- (Cheers and applause) Taught me that my body at any sculpt,
at any shape is beautiful, right? Wonder Woman spent her entire life -- Y'all can clap. (Applause) Wonder Woman spent
her entire life training for battle. She was not going to be a size zero. She was going to have
quadriceps and deltoids. I learned that word
a couple of weeks ago, deltoid. (Laughter) And she was going to look strong and look beautiful while doing it. Alright, the fourth one. (Cheers and applause) Venus and Serena,
as any Black girl, specifically -- We were forced to watch them, whether or not we liked tennis or not. (Laughter) It's also because it came on cable
so you didn't have to, like, look for it. But my North Star as a big sister
has always been these two. Because when the world was against them,
they always had each other. So whether or not I am being
a good sister in the moment, that is what I always look towards. (Applause) All right. Sneakers taught me the importance
of quality and detail, and nerds -- Sneaker heads, you all are nerds. Nobody cares about quality leather
from 1987 to 2022 except y'all. Y'all need to just accept it. (Laughter) ""Harry Potter"" fan fiction -- (Cheers and applause) Taught me that I could write
myself into any story. Those books are about this big and Black people
had about what, eight words? (Laughter) So I wanted to fill in those gaps
and I was very good at it too. Also wrote some smut,
you can look for that later. (Laughter) “Sailor Moon” ... (Cheers and applause) Taught me the power of female friendships. That's it. (Applause) And now, this isn't really a lesson, but my father is a massive nerd and he would see me glomming on
to these superheroes, Storm, and he would be like,
""Well, what about Black Panther? What about Luke Cage?
What about Misty Knight?"" And in doing that,
he was trying to teach me, yes, you can love everything that is current,
but you have to know about your past. And so showing me all of these Black
superheroes from the '70s, from the '60s, kind of led me through life. And now I'm a nerd here talking to you
all here, so blame him. Boy bands. (Applause) B2K specifically, taught me
to scream really loud. (Laughter) Then Chyna ... (Cheers and applause) Taught me that I can be
the ninth wonder of the world, that I can stand in a ring
or an office room or here on this red carpet and take command, right? Because in a lot of rooms, I will probably be the only woman. I will probably be the only Black person. I'm for damn sure probably
going to be the only Black woman. So people are going to look at me anyway. I should have something to say. I should be able to take center stage. (Applause) So listen, don't be afraid of the F word. Because when you love
what you love out loud, that is audacious. When you love what you love
unapologetically, it is beautiful. All right, so fuck it, y'all, be a fan. (Cheers and applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #climatechange","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'nature', 'future', 'activism', 'Countdown']",2023-08-03T11:36:56-07:00,2023-08-03T11:36:56-07:00,Science & Technology,"I want you to imagine it’s 1992, and you're talking to a telecoms expert. She tells you that mobile phone
text messaging is going to fundamentally change the way we communicate. You think, ""But we use our phones
just for voice calls. Why on Earth am I going to go from this to tapping on a screen
with my fingers and my thumbs?"" In 1992, the first text message was sent. After a slow start, text-based services exploded. Today, over 23 billion messages are sent every single day. This paved the way
for the smartphone revolution that we have seen today. And other technology trends
have followed that same curve. I know how much we struggle to comprehend and predict what
“exponential change” means. Because I was at Nokia in 1993 when that technological
revolution started. And now as head of UN Climate Change, I'm here to tell you that what was true
for mobile phones back in 1992, and other revolutionary shifts, is also true for climate action today. To make climate action
go from linear to exponential pace, it's not just my job to make it happen. It's also your job, too. We all know that climate impacts
are hitting harder and harder every day. The ambition we need to see,
reducing emissions, adapting to impacts and providing the means
to address the crisis, are severely lacking. But just like technology, public opinion has its tipping point. In my youth, I campaigned
against apartheid. Participating in that fight, those demonstrations, meant shaking the foundations of a system
many thought would never change. But then, one day, after generations of slow progress,
the system changed. The pressure was too great. The point tipped. We're here in Detroit,
the heart of car manufacturing. Take a look at this graph. Electric vehicle sales
are expected to increase to become 70 percent by 2030. Another example. Solar energy. Between 2010 and 2020, we moved from 20 gigawatts
of solar energy installed to 150 gigawatts. Now, just three years later, that number is expected to increase
to 350 gigawatts per year. And by 2030, that number is expected to increase
again to 1,000 gigawatts per year. Change can come fast. But time isn't on our side. We have less than seven years
between now and 2030 to halve our global emissions. So the question is: Will those tipping
points come soon enough to avoid the catastrophic impacts
of climate change? At out current speed,
change will come too late to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. That is the hard truth
of the global stocktake that will be completed
by the UNFCCC this year. But this is where you come in. You may think it's not
your responsibility to drive change. You may not think you have
the power to make this happen. Both of those statements are wrong. At the UNFCCC, we are the custodians of the process. We're the defenders of the agreements. We are the champions of parties
and the agreements that they make. But globally, we're collectively in a state
of what the author Kim Stanley Robinson describes as “The Dithering.” A state of indecision and a state of inaction
in the face of a global crisis. But countries will agree
to boost in action. If enough people encourage them to do so. Contact your representatives and ask them
what they are doing to deliver. What plans do they have to ensure that your concerns
on climate count? That direct action does work. I have seen positions change
time and time again when citizens engage directly. Every time you buy something, ask yourself the question: Is this the greenest option? Ask those around you
about their green choices. Learn new things. Educate and mobilize. The power of human organization
can result in change. Which brings me to my final point. You don't have to be a politician or a prominent business person to make a significant contribution. Climate action calls for all skill sets. Ask yourself: What am I passionate about? What am I good at? What am I training for? Then ask yourself the question, how can I apply this
to the climate crisis? And do exactly that thing. If you act, the exponential change
that is needed will happen. I thank you. (Applause)"

Kauffman']",2023-08-28T04:00:39-07:00,2023-08-28T04:00:39-07:00,Science & Technology,foreign years ago heraclitus said the world bubbles forth here's bubbling what is actual now enables what is next possible the adjacent possible the biaser has been bubbling forth for four billion years of creating new possibilities in the universe and that bubbling it's critical that physics cannot talk at all about bubbling new bubbles life on earth started 4 billion years ago it is for the first two and a half billion years where single cell organisms co-evolving even my existing organisms create new possibilities if I'm a bacterium and you're a bacterium and I have a flat surface I'm a possible Highway you can walk over to get food that's bubbling forth so two and a half billion years after life started six times multicell organisms emerged a billion years after that three and a half billions after life started is the extraordinary Cambrian explosion 540 million years ago for 50 million years there was just this burst of creativity making all of the phyla that exists now and now we have this guy I just I'm scared of having him in bed I really am so I don't know what to call him and uh it's a vote afterwards so here's a gentler guy and I'm in love with him look at his eyes looking at you you know you're doing what in order to talk about how the biosor has been creative I have to talk about the functions of parts of an organ you all know your heart keeps you alive but in particular your heart pumps blood it's not by making heart sounds so this means something fundamental the function of a part is that subset of its causal properties that sustain the holes your heart pumping blood on you but doing that is jury rigging finding subsets of causal features of use some years ago my daughter dropped her purse in a shallow well I took a wire coat hanger slid it over a mop handle and I fished out her purse anything can be used for more than one thing uh for example a screwdriver can be used to screw in a screw but it's great for scraping Putty off the wall an engine block and have eight holes drilled and you make an engine out of it it's actually a superb paperweight and much research done only by scientists demonstrates that the corners are sharp and can crack open a coconut I was very proud of that so but if you're using an engine block as a paperweight can you deduce oh I can use this thing to crack open coconuts you can't it might be a banana peel but that means also something fundamental finding new uses for things jury rigging is not a computation it's not a deduction jury rigging is not a computation at all computers are the biosphere is forever innovating in this kind of way that's not a deduction for example there are things called darwinian pre-adaptations dinosaurs had scales that were evolved from thermoregulation that were injury rigged into flight feathers your eyes have clear crystallines that were perfectly normal colored enzymes and this too means something fundamentals we cannot deduce what is in the adjacent possible that the evolving biosphere will create then become we do not even know what can happen in fact we can use no mathematics based on set theory which is all of mathematics to deduce what the bioser is going to become or the economy this means we are at a fantastic third trade phase transition in science we're Beyond Newton we're Beyond quantum mechanics we're beyond the Exquisite view the Copernicus had 480 years ago that the world of the Clockwork the biosphere Is Not A Clockwork the paper that just published it came out three days ago and I'm pretty proud of it it's it's actually worth reading we can't deduce what is in the biosphere and will become so we can make a mathematical theory of the statistics of the process I call it the theory of the adjacent possible or tap it's really based on one idea things can be combined to make new things so there's the equation m t is the number of things in the economy at some time now say 10 things so how many things will be in the economy in the next period Well if the 10 things work we'll keep them but we could actually try to jury rig something new out of any single thing among the ten or out a pair of things among the ten the printing press is a recombination between movable type and a wine press or any three things or four things watch what happens to the number of things pairs of things when the number of things goes up if there's ten things there's 45 pairs of things that we might fiddle with if there's a hundred things those four thousand five hundred things we might jury rig with and if there's a thousand things there's a half a million things we might fiddle with therefore this process the tap process has the property that for a long time the number of things increases very very very slowly then something stunning happens there's a hockey stick explosion and the number of things reaches Infinity in a finite time there's there's a singularity and a brief burst explosion for 40 million years of the Cambrian explosion the same pattern is showing up in our own Evolution Australopithecus flourished I'd never know what flourishing means I guess they had a good lunch uh in Africa 3.3 million years ago a million and a half years later Homo erectus had about 20 crude stone tools watch how slowly things change a mere 30 000 years ago Crow Manion in the south of France had about 100 or 150 of these Exquisite pressure flake tools a mere 28 000 years after that is Mesopotamia with needles and chariots there's something interesting about the fact of course we invented writing which is a wonderful Story Once you have a clay tablet it calls forth the tool that's its complement you need a stylus so tools to make niches for new tools and for new jobs scribes earned a living for quite a while This Is Us in the late Middle Ages to now and this is us now we have billions of tools ranging from knitting needles to the space station there's always an adjacent possible once you've made a bow a crossbows in the adjacent possible the pattern that we saw in the Cambrian of a long period nothing happening and then a burst is here right now this is the size of human habitats in the last three hundred thousand years the horizontal line is time before present on the vertical line as the logarithm of sizes of settlements nothing happened for 290 000 years then it burst upward watch this the same thing's true of GDP GDP was flat since the time of Christ in fact for the last hundred thousand years GDP burst up in the last two centuries it's going up vertically now it's wonderful we're lifting Millions from poverty and the theory explains it it's the same delay and burst and there it is we start making more complex things selling them and we make a profit there's another feature of all of this that I've lived in my lifetime I I'm 83 I was born in 1939 just like the Cambrian explosion watch the number of things that have come into existence in my lifetime we didn't have any helicopters we we didn't have television I I listened to the Lone Ranger which maybe you know but on radio six o'clock at night uh we we didn't have uh a computers we didn't have Plastics which are now all over the planet we didn't have microwaves we didn't have lasers look at the number of things that came into existence in one lifetime of 83 years not much happened 50 000 years ago in 83 years so what's going on the tap process has the following property every time you make something new the waiting time for the next new things cut in half a thousand years 500 years 250 a year six months three months we're going to get a great acceleration we are so this is tap and watch that thing explode upward that's it that explosion is the Cambrian and it's where we are now and the signatures of the uh anthropocene are exploding upward now all over the place this ends 25 years ago we need to find a better adjacent possible we're rampaging over the planet and the hope is in soils so I'm going to talk briefly about compost there are very fine composes not terribly important a very good compost is the Johnson Sioux compost less land use fewer the degradations of uh of our forests fewer Extinction events fewer pandemics well let's get rid of fertilizer and the most important point I'm going to take is this is really bad news and good news last year we emitted 40.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide we have to find a way of solving it and we can um we can take this Johnson suit compost and get it out across the landscape but more fundamentally we can find good fungal bacterial communities and we can coat seeds with it and sell the seeds around the planet or we could fill uh biochar and we can use biocharge getter across the planet most usefully we can take a really good fungal bacterial Community put it into biochar some other Matrix mix it into fertilizer and get that fertilizer out across the planet I'm going to just end with the following fungal bacterial communities are precisely something that can create novel adjacent possibles that can bubble forth with solutions to soil problems the good news is we can do it now the planet's on fire we are of nature ladies and gentlemen we're not above nature thank you thank you

#TED #TEDTalks #blindness","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'health', 'sight', 'blindness', 'human body', 'inclusion', 'Andrew Leland']",2023-07-28T08:56:52-07:00,2023-07-28T08:56:52-07:00,People & Blogs,"(Audio description) A white man
with glasses sits at a marble table next to a plate of sliced pears. Hi, I'm Andrew Leland. I'm blind. And this is a TED Talk about blindness, which is confusing for me and for you because just by watching me right now,
you can probably tell I'm not blind. For example, I can tell
that on this plate right here, there are five slices of pear
arranged in a smiley face. Or that that -- (AD) A framed photo
hangs on the wall behind him. AL: Is a photograph of a very sad hippo. So you might be wondering,
if I can see all that, why am I talking about blindness? OK, so I'm going blind. I don't know exactly when. As a teenager, I was diagnosed
with retinitis pigmentosa, or RP, which is a degenerative retinal condition. In my teens and early 20s, I only noticed it at night. Then in my early 30s, my peripheral
vision started to deteriorate. Right now I have central vision, but I'm seeing the world
through a pretty narrow porthole. So even though I can see these pears
and that hippo, I'm legally blind. I have severe tunnel vision, but it doesn't look like a tunnel because your brain adapts
really quickly to whatever you see. Like if the frame
of the movie you're watching starts to shrink to a much smaller size,
at first you'll be annoyed. ""This sucks,"" you might say to yourself, ""I don't like watching this movie
on this tiny screen."" Then your complaints
will soften and disappear, and your brain will adapt
to the new normal. Like the first time you watch
a movie on your cell phone, it will be annoyingly small at first,
and then you just get used to it. So every time I lose
another chunk of vision, at first I feel super extra blind, sometimes scared or claustrophobic. My world is shrinking. But then a week will go by,
I get used to it, I don't feel so blind anymore. This experience of super gradual
vision loss has given me time to think about what blindness is, which might seem like an obvious question. Blindness is the absence of sight, but it's actually
more complicated than that. Trying to define blindness
can start to feel paradoxical. There's a paradox that's useful
in thinking about blindness. It's called the paradox of the heap. Let's say you have a heap of something,
like sand or marbles or goji berries. Now imagine I take a single little
goji berry off of the heap. Is it still a heap? OK, what if I remove a second
tiny little goji berry from the heap? Obviously that is still a heap also. But, the ancient Greek
philosopher wondered, at what point is it no longer a heap? How many goji berries do I have to remove? Is it still a heap
when there's only ten left? Five? Vision works this way too. How much vision do I need to lose before I can legitimately
call myself blind? I saw this photo online the other day. (AD) In the photo,
a Black woman holds a white cane and looks at a cell phone. AL: The image circulated with a caption, ""If you can see what's wrong,
say 'I see it.'"" Can you see what's wrong with this photo? The answer that the people
sharing the photo had is that the woman can't be blind. If she is, why is she
looking at her phone? Blind people don't look at things. The caption wants you to remember:
blind people don’t see. And if she can see, what's she doing with that long white cane that signals to the world
that she's blind? Maybe she's trying to get sympathy
that she doesn't deserve or trying to trick us somehow. So how blind you have to be to be blind? How much vision do you have to remove
from the heap of sight before it becomes blindness? People love binaries,
especially people on the internet, which is a place that's not always
very friendly to ambiguity. This photo was shared
more than 33,000 times, and I think it went viral
exactly because of its ambiguity. It illuminates a weird,
paradoxical truth about blindness. Blind people can see. I don't mean this in the way
that people mean it when they talk about Daniel Kish. Kish makes clicking sounds with his mouth that he uses to navigate his environment
the way a bat uses sonar. Brain scans show that when Kish navigates
his environment this way, using his DIY sonar,
his visual cortex lights up. That's amazing. But the point I'm making is much simpler. On the one hand, blindness is a binary. You're either blind or you're not. But on the other hand,
blindness is a spectrum. There are different degrees of blindness
and different styles. Some people have the inverse
of what I've got. They only see through their peripheral
vision with nothing in the center. Other blind people see the world as though their glasses
have been smeared with Vaseline or their head's been wrapped
several times in saran wrap or like they're looking through
a thick, broken fishbowl. Only very few blind people
see nothing at all, total darkness. As I lose my sight, I experienced this degeneration
the way you might expect: as a loss. In the meantime, I feel privileged to still be able to see
things like sunsets or tree frogs or celebrity breakfasts on Instagram. There's another paradox
lurking around here. If blindness is a spectrum, could it also include somebody
who's not actually blind? The paradox works the other way. How much sight do you have to add
before someone's no longer blind? At a certain point, we do have to agree
that someone's not blind, even if they don't see very well. I do think it's important
to reserve blindness for people who don't have the luxury
of correcting their vision, who need assistive technology to do things
like read print or walk around. On the other hand, separating out
blindness like this can lead people to view the blind
as strange or mysterious or off-putting. And that can lead to fear and sometimes
damaging misconceptions and stereotypes, like the idea that blind
people are psychic, which some people actually believe, or that they have super hearing. (AD) Words appear:
Superpowers for the blind. The brain rewires itself
to boost the remaining senses. AL: Or more destructively, that they can't go to a normal school or hold a normal job
or travel on their own. So the next time you see
a blind person do something that you think only
a sighted person should do, like making eye contact with you
or watching a movie, or standing at a bus stop
checking their phone, remember, it might be possible
to see even if you're blind."

#TED #TEDTalks #climatechange","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'China', 'policy', 'US', 'Countdown', 'renewable energy', 'international relations', 'Changhua Wu']",2023-09-15T04:00:00-07:00,2023-09-15T04:00:00-07:00,News & Politics,"You don't hear much praise for China
in the United States these days. To be fair, China doesn't say
great things about the US either. (Laughter) The two big nations are stuck
in a geopolitical deadlock that is bad for progress
to fight climate change. I'm a China sustainability policy analyst and I have witnessed
a clean energy revolution there that could mean big things
for the rest of the world. But it's become clear to me that if the US continues
to see China as a threat, the desired transition
will never happen at the faster pace and the larger scale as expected. We urgently need to pivot
from the currently dismal relations and reset a constructive
rather than destructive foundation for a global clean energy revolution. (Applause) Let's take a look
at the clean energy manufacturing, because this seems to be
where the tension lies today. Some US commentators said, ""The best chance was 10 years ago.
The second best chance is now."" The best chance was China's drive to invest aggressively and ambitiously
in clean technologies with the China Make 2025 campaign. The outcome is massive deployment
of clean energy solutions that established China
as a global leader in this landscape. The US Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, a climate law that pushes for investments
in domestic clean energy production, represents the second best chance. The IEA executive director Fatih
vividly called this dynamic “the beginning of a new age
of clean energy manufacturing.” A decade apart, China and the US
stand at a different position along the global value chain. While China is already
in the second decade of transition, the US is just starting to take off. The recent data shows China provided
77 percent of global batteries last year and it is right on track
to lead all nations in manufacturing
clean energy products by 2030. China's investment
has also put it as a global leader, leading exporter of those technologies:
solar, wind, batteries, you name it. My professional experience also tells me that the US can learn a great deal
from China's steadfast dedication to push forward the clean energy
transition in some key ways. Firstly, China is re-energizing
the world's largest energy system with renewables
and smart grid infrastructure. And the US can adapt this
with a much shorter learning curve and reduced costs. The first half of this year
saw 34 percent of China’s electricity generated from non-fossil fuels, right on track to deliver 
39 percent by 2025, as has been planned, and aiming for 80 percent by 2035. Between now and 2035, China's national endeavors are focused
on rapid expansion of installations and also consumption of clean energy
in all sectors you could imagine. In the meantime, it's also dedicated to enhancing
grid transmission and distribution systems to accommodate this growth of renewables. US and China operate power systems
in two different regulatory contexts, but share the logic and also technicality when designing and building a clean, smart, net-zero
carbon emissions grid system. China is also becoming a real daredevil in pioneering the development of 5G and AI-enabled power systems and deploying the
ultra-high-voltage grid systems supplemented by
vehicle-to-grid technologies in order to accommodate the rise of EVs. China's experience can provide
an invaluable reference or insight for the US to decarbonize
your own power system. Secondly, China is leading
a global campaign to increase solar usage. The social, economic and environmental
model deployed in China can help the US to address
climate injustice challenges domestically. Solar energy is becoming
the least-cost option for new electricity generation
in most parts of the world today. The IEA forecasts an average annual
solar generation growth of 25 percent between 2022 and 2030, which is about 10 times
of the current total global installations, in order to achieve net-zero
carbon emissions by mid-century. Or to put it another way, this is one kilowatt
solar installation per person by 2030. That number stands today
at one-tenth kilowatt globally. China is on its way
to achieve two-fifths kilowatt by the end of this year. To bridge the gap, a group of leading
Chinese universities and institutions launched a China campaign advocating one kilowatt
solar installation per person by 2030. The strategy is -- and also
turning that into a global campaign, called Solar Lights the Planet. The strategy is to really use
solar installation as the intervention point to explore how rural
energy transition in China can benefit other
UN sustainability targets. On one side, it's cost-effective. One kilowatt solar installation
requires five square meters of space and a 500-dollar
upfront investment to install. When completed,
it generates green electricity while avoiding carbon emissions. And on the other side, it also demonstrates that co-benefits
can be created and maximized. Rapid rural energy transition
can bring new investment and also create green power-enabled
growth opportunities, for instance, food, agriculture,
fishery, energy services, tourism and other industries. China's experience definitely
can be very valuable for the US to think about the solutions
to address climate injustice. Solar Lights The Planet is the ambition. It also offers colleagues
in the United States to work with peers from China
and other parts of the world to really tackle
the climate injustice challenge. Thirdly, China is mainstreaming
a circular economy and transforming its supply chains. Joining forces, China,
the US, together with the EU, can literally reset the global
supply chain solidly on sustainability. China is a global
manufacturing powerhouse. Its demand for raw materials and critical metals
is growing exponentially. As we all know, the planet
cannot possibly afford the ecological destruction from quadruple, and in some cases even six times
the current import of critical metals to match the planned energy transition. A circular economy offers a remedy
to decouple the growth from resource use. China is also well positioned
to reset its supply chains with circularity at the core. Today, China recycles more than
95 percent of nickel and lithium. Business communities
have a big role to play, providing solutions or answers
to what hurdles to remove, what innovative solutions to deploy, what business models actually to promote, and very importantly,
how to consolidate a global partnership to work together to shape our sustainable
and circular global supply chain. Which is why a group of Chinese
organizations are working together, kicking off a China
Circularity 100 initiative, aiming by 2030 to really find the pathways to close the loop in recycling
for critical metals and also for the energy sector. It's targeting at least 100 companies to work together
to find the alternative pathways. China's practice can become
a very important reference for the United States
to make investment decisions to embrace circularity now. So how do we jump-start
a new US-China partnership? Well, the two governments ...
should start with a revised narrative, one that is with good intention,
as well as with collaborative spirit. In the meantime, the two nations
need to assure the rest of the world that they are really seriously
and sincerely working together to find their alternative
and to rebuild partnership. One thing to keep in mind: the climate change doesn't care
about our ideological divide. Rather, it demands for collective actions
that deliver outcomes. Cornering China
as a national security threat seems to claim that the US,
rather than China, is the legitimate and trustworthy
global leader in this transition. And yet, as the world's largest
developed economy, the US doesn't meet the bar
of what's expected of a global leader. Along the line, it doesn't provide
the rest of the world with sufficient, accessible
and affordable clean energy solutions, nor does it provide, deliver
its financial commitments to other developing countries
under the Paris Agreement. And China undoubtedly
has to go a long way too in rethinking its strategy and behavior
in dealing with the US. It needs to make extra efforts
to convince the world that it's not a threat,
but rather a trusted partner, willing and capable to work with the US to shift towards
a collaborative partnership. Let me leave this stage
with some sort of cautious optimism. My heart feels enlightened
when media in our two countries start to tell different US-China stories. Treasury Secretary Yellen's
China trip last week went viral in Chinese social media. The rainbow welcoming
her landing in Beijing Airport represents some hope and also a new beginning
of bilateral relations. And her love for the wild mushroom
soup from Yunnan province -- (Laughter) literally gives me this kind of a warm
and also sweet human touch. And I have a message
to climate envoy John Kerry, who is coming to China later this month. You know, the two governments
have already declared quite a number of joint commitments
and collective actions to fight climate change. What's urgently needed now
is a shared vision, mission, aspiration, wisdom and very importantly, a compass to guide everyone back on track, to take collective actions
and deliver the due results. It seems to me that's
the must-have precondition for us all in order to keep
a sustainable future within reach. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #creativity","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'technology', 'creativity', 'art', 'virtual reality', 'metaverse', 'Lucas Rizzotto']",2023-08-02T08:40:52-07:00,2023-08-02T08:40:52-07:00,Science & Technology,"So a couple of years ago, I went through a pretty brutal breakup, and to keep myself distracted, I decided to set myself
a ridiculous art challenge: o create the closest thing
to a real-life time machine with very little technical experience and the bank account
of a college graduate. Now, I know this sounds crazy, but avoiding your feelings
is a very powerful force. And I had a plan. You see, all I had to do was to spend an entire year
wearing 3D cameras on my face, record my life
in first person for 365 days, transfer that into a series of hard drives and then build
a virtual reality simulation that will let me experience
those memories in 3D. That's all I had to do. In other words, I was going to create
a personal time machine, a virtual-reality invention
that will let me go back in time and experience moments from my past. And building this was pretty insane. I had to learn a lot of technical skills
in a really short span of time, and for an entire year,
my Tinder profile looked like this. (Laughter) But in the end, it was all worth it because the final result
was so much cooler than I could have ever imagined. So this is how it works. You put on a VR headset, you select a date
and time you’d like to go back to, you pull a lever and then, bam. I got to see exactly what I saw
at that given point in time. And in this case, I was eating
a bagel in a tree, which was the thing that I used to do. And now I could go back in time
and re-experience a past trip, try a meal again for the first time and even hang out with a friend
who is no longer with us. And the longer I spent
with this time machine, the more I realized that I had
accidentally built something that was much more meaningful
than I initially imagined. Because this wasn't just an entirely new
way for you to experience your memories. This was an entirely new way
for you to understand yourself. As I used the time machine, I started to become hyper aware
of how much of our lives we forget over the years and how important it is for us
to enjoy the moments we have before our minds inevitably forget them. I learned to be kinder to myself, as watching myself wander
through life in third person kind of taught me how much
of a dick I am to myself when things get rough. And I even started to have
an active friendship with myself, as in many of my recordings,
you find me talking to future me, sending thoughts, hopes
and feelings across time. And this was really cool. And it was also really confusing. Because I was just trying
to get over my ex with some art. But somehow by mixing art and technology, we ended up in a really interesting place. And the world agreed. The time machine went super viral, 50 million people saw it, and it even inspired people
to start entire companies based off this concept. So it seemed that by mixing art and tech, I created something
innovative by accident. And because that made me feel pretty good, I was like, can we do that again? Could I just take emerging technology, you know, the stuff that's weird,
the stuff that we don't understand, do some art and just
accidentally innovate? And so our journey begins. A couple of months go by,
and ladies and gentlemen, I was back in the game. I had a new girlfriend. Her name was Max,
and things were going well, and Valentine's Day
was just around the corner. So me being me, I decided to gift her
a little bit of an art project. So we're about to see is
what I can see from my perspective. I'm wearing an AR headset
that's tracking her body in real time. So here we go. So love is a really abstract feeling. It's something we all feel
but we can't see or hear. So I created this experience
that turned the touch between two lovers into this visual and auditory symphony, basically transforming intimacy
into visuals and sounds, which I thought was pretty cool. And Max got to play me too,
which I think she liked. But when I posted this online, people started telling me that I had built
something completely different. And that is when I realized that by engaging in this artistic
exploration of intimacy, I created a new kind
of musical instrument, a particle synthesizer that lets you play
complex sounds in midair like this. (Music) Pretty cool, right? (Applause) Wait, we're not done. Just for good measure, I took those instruments,
and I attached them to a piece of clothing so I could now play my own clothes
with my hand in mid-air, which is ridiculous. And I think it's the first example
of interactive digital musical fashion. So for better or for worse, art took us to some
really interesting ideas. And at this point, I thought
I was onto something. But then I had another breakup. Audience: Aww. LR: But it’s OK because an artist
can do what an artist does best, which is to turn heartbreak into art. So jokes aside, this was actually
a really difficult time in my life because not only I was going through
all of that emotional turmoil, I was also moving
to an entirely new country. I was leaving my hometown from Brazil and moving into the United States,
thousands of miles away from family, no friends, didn't know anybody. So it was probably the loneliest
I've been in my entire life. So why not use this opportunity to take
my misery and make something cool? What if we use VR
to create an experience that's specifically designed
to foster the connection that I needed to make me feel closer to strangers? And that was the genesis
of ""Where Thoughts Go."" So this is how it works. You enter these virtual worlds in which you're surrounded
by these sleeping creatures. Each one of them is a voice message
left by another user who was there before you were. If you raise your fingers
and touch them gently, you can listen to the voice messages
that people have left behind. And in each one of these worlds, you're asked a different
personal question. So by playing this experience, you're essentially going down
an intimacy funnel in which you're getting to learn
about deeply intimate aspects of other people's lives. And of course, at the end
of each one of these worlds, you can put your hands together,
give birth to your own little creature, speak into it, and leave your messages
behind for others to find. It was sweet, beautiful, anonymous. And people would say things
in this experience that they wouldn't share
with their closest friends. And when I was making this, everyone told me it was a horrible idea. People would tell me
that trolls would destroy the entire app, that people would be mean to each other, they would make each other cry. And you know what? They weren't wrong. (Laughter) So when I started testing
""Where Thoughts Go"" with the first couple of hundred users, I found out that roughly
20 percent of them were crying at least once per session. This is what I like to call
""Where Thoughts Go's"" cry rate. But people weren't crying
because they were being bullied. People were crying because they were
feeling emotionally moved by the messages of others. We had created a system that instilled
a deep sense of empathy and connection in a really short span of time. And by making this, not only I was able
to get the connection that I was craving, but I was able to give it
to others as well. And because of how
this experience was designed, there were virtually zero
trolls in the system. It's like people
were walking into a church and instinctively knew
to lower their voices, treat each other respectfully and treat the space
they were in as sacred, which is a cool thing
you can only do in VR. And when I put things that way, it's clear that there's something
interesting here. Some innovative ideas that could be used, designs and lessons and approach
that could be applied towards the entire internet. But at this point,
you might go like, Lucas, you're not really innovating anymore. There's a lot of thought behind this. And yes, but no, because a year
after I launched this, medical doctors contacted me and told me
I invented a new form of group therapy. And now this art piece
is being used in a medical trial as an anxiety treatment tool. And shortly after that, I got to collaborate
with SpaceX and St Jude's to make a version of this
that astronauts could use so they could emotionally connect
with kids on Earth. This is not what I was trying to do. (Laughter) (Applause) But that's when it started to make sense. And it's really simple. When you take technology
that we don't understand and you approach it as an artist, you do things that the conventional
engineer would never think of doing. And when you do that in a space brimming
with possibility, like emerging tech, it's only a matter of time before you
stumble upon something of value. That is why mixing art and tech
is a great way to accidentally innovate. It takes you off the beaten path,
it removes creative constraints, and it allows you to approach technology
in a way that's unique to you, that leverages your passions
and your interests and your life events and breakups. And all of this just comes together
and gives you a unique angle of approach. And that unique angle is everything. Because here's the thing
about emerging technology, and this applies to everything, VR, AI,
brain computers and whatever’s next. No one knows what they're doing. Everyone is just following blind hunches. It's too early
in a technology's life cycle for anyone to have a comprehensive view
of what it's good for. And in a world where no one
knows what they're doing, just following your gut
is a really great thing to do. Because what we have here
is unlimited creative potential. It's the ability to create
impossible objects out of thin air at no carbon costs, the ability to connect people
in ways never possible before. And it's the ability to create technology
that changes how we look at ourselves and the world around us. We have all the tools we need
to create a future that's beautiful and human and exciting. And the only thing that threatens this is if we have a massive
lapse of imagination. So ... Today I’m working on a new
project called “Pillow,” and I'm trying to turn your bed,
the most comfortable place in your home, into a mixed reality playground
of wellness, play and human connection. And this is an early prototype,
but look how beautiful this is. We're using mixed reality
to connect two beds together and give people a way to engage
that's never been possible before. And even though this is early, there's so much that we're learning about how to create meaningful connections between people and virtual environments, how to use artificial intelligence
to create immersive experiences that really feel personal and how to approach products
with accessibility in mind from the get-go. Things that work just as well
lying down on a couch as they do in a hospital bed. And I don't know where
this is going to go, but it's going to be
somewhere interesting. And when I look at this,
I just don't see art. I see research. I see things that could be turned
into products and companies. And I want more artists
to start tech companies. We need more artists in technology, but we also just need more technologists
to think a little bit like artists. Because some of the world's
most important ideas, you really can't stumble upon them by just trying to chase
the highest valuation. Sometimes you only stumble upon them when you approach technology
from a place of truth. When you build things just
because you need to make them and you don't know where you're going,
but if you follow your gut, you will be rewarded. And I don't know how or when, like with anything else
that I told you about today, but you will be rewarded. We will all be rewarded. And being true to yourself is just
a really good long-term strategy. Technology gives us the tools,
but art shows us the way. It's always been like this. It's hard to find
a single futuristic startup that hasn't been deeply inspired
by some kind of science fiction material. Engineers have always followed
the imaginations of artists, and that's not going
to change anytime soon. But what is changing is that technology
is becoming easier to use. I didn't know how to do
any of this five years ago. Artists don't have to be
in the background anymore. We can get our hands dirty
and build science nonfiction instead to create projects and companies that challenge the engineer-dominated
visions of technology and propose something new, something a little weirder
with a little more heart. And I think in the process,
we can unlock new realities that not only we are excited to live in, but that we're excited to see
our children grow up in. For the longest time in technology
artists imagine so engineers can build. But I think engineers build,
so artists can imagine. So if you have a crazy project
in your back pocket, something you always wanted to do
but never got around to, you should go for it. You will never know what
you're going to find on the other side. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

#TED #TEDTalks #circularcity","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'sustainability', 'design', 'business', 'cities', 'Social Change', 'community', 'Garry Cooper']",2023-07-26T10:07:44-07:00,2023-07-26T10:07:44-07:00,Science & Technology,"A few days ago, I flew in from Chicago. I love it there. Chicago has it all. Oh, thank you. Chicago has it all. Great food, incredible skyline
and architecture and the kindest Midwestern folks
you'll ever meet. Diversity of people
and culture, second to none. Millions of people move
to cities like Chicago each year to pursue their life's
dreams and passions. I know I did. And that's because cities are booming
marketplaces of people and companies, of products and materials and something not so great: waste and greenhouse gas emissions. According to a 2022 World Bank report, our beloved communities
could be responsible for 25 gigatons of carbon emissions and a ton and ton of waste. But what does this mean
for your community? Think about that building being torn down, maybe on the corner
next to your office or your home and all the wood and concrete and steel or the office equipment or computers or furniture being tossed out,
dumped in a landfill, often near the homes
of our low-income neighbors. In the United States, 40 percent of landfill contain materials
from the construction and demolition of buildings. This is our linear economy. It's bad for our climate, it's bad for our health,
and it's a missed economic opportunity. But we can turn this line into a circle. Many connected circles, in fact, where every a physical resource
finds another use and another life, driving down greenhouse gas emissions
from new manufacturing, shrinking harmful landfill
and creating a lot of jobs. This disconnected linear economy becomes a circular one when we transform our concept of ownership into a system where every person
and every business has access to the things
others no longer find useful. Wood from that building being torn down
could be a dining room table. Bricks could be concrete again and furniture can be rehabbed and resold to an up-and-coming start-up. Now my circular economy journey
started on a pretty small scale. I was a neuroscientist in a lab
at Northwestern University. At that time, in my lab,
there were hundreds if not thousands of biological tools and things like microscopes,
that were going completely unused. In fact, research budgets
were tight then and actually now, but still, these things
sat around collecting dust. No one even knew they existed. So I loaded up a push cart, rolled it around my floor
with these items, visited my colleagues,
shared what we no longer needed and they might be able to. Rheaply, the company I founded and run, helps organizations identify
and catalog the things they own, reuse them internally when they can and distribute them to other
organizations when they cannot. It's like a high-tech, scaled-up version
of me with the push cart at Northwestern, but with hundreds of organizations, from technology to manufacturing leaders, and millions of items
available for ale and donation -- all cataloged on a digital platform, stretching across partners
in a local area, a city or state, creating connected networks of reuse. Rheaply helps organizations reuse
things like building materials and IT and industrial
equipment and furniture. But companies like Goodr or Olio
help reduce food waste by connecting surplus food
to people who are hungry. And companies like Queen of Raw
and Trove and Recurate create circular loops for textiles, apparel and other branded goods. Let's take a look
at how it works for furniture. An investment bank in New York City
had about 2,000 premium office chairs that they no longer could use. When they hired us, we sent in a team to inventory
that furniture on that floor. We photographed it, we tagged it
and we uploaded it to the system. When it was determined that these items
could no longer be useful internally, a notification was sent out through
our platform to all of our partners, hundreds of them. I'm happy to report that all
of these chairs found new homes in a local university, a community housing organization and a local refurbishment company. Thank you. (Applause) In total, about 68,000 pounds
of potential waste was diverted from landfill, and about 100,000 dollars of value was recaptured and shared
with these organizations. Not to mention the carbon savings. Making one of these office chairs,
which weighs about 55 pounds, releases 245 pounds of carbon
emissions into the atmosphere. Now, this is just a small set
of furniture on one floor in one building of one bank
in New York City. Think of all the other office equipment
and IT infrastructure that we could be reusing. In this specific case, the bank paid us as a part of meeting
their sustainability goals, but the chairs were mostly donated. Sometimes furniture or equipment
or materials can be resold even for a 50-plus percent discount. Sometimes refurbished
and sometimes split into parts and used by industrial recycler. OK. So we know how to create
a circular economy with a microscope on a pushcart
like me at Northwestern. And we know how to do so inside and outside of a building
with either its building materials or things like IT infrastructure
on a digital platform like Rheaply. But how do we get to the scale of a city? And why? Well, cities occupy about three percent
of global land mass but house over 50 percent
of the global population, which commands over 75 percent
of all global resources. Cities are perfect, tractable fronts for us to drive down
greenhouse gas emissions and create a lot of jobs
by building local circular economies. Now to transition any city's linear
economy to a circular one, we're going to, at the very least,
have to do three things. First, we have to build
a digital infrastructure to connect every citizen
and every company to everything in their city. Next, we're going to have to build
the operational infrastructure to make reuse and recycling
and remanufacturing easy and universally acceptable. Next, we're going to have to incentivize
every person and business to participate in their
local circular economy. As you might expect from a person like me, technology is at the heart
of any circular city. So at the very first step, we have to provide
universal access to the internet. But then very quickly after, we have to create local marketplaces, collections of digital platforms where anything from toys
to building materials can be posted, found, collected and exchanged. Now, this is already happening
on platforms like Craigslist and Facebook and the Buy Nothing Project, but we have to go much bigger and expand
into many more product categories. In fact, we’re going
to have to like, Google Map all the industrial equipment
to office furniture in our cities. Because in a circular city, we actually have to know where things are. But if we can do this, we create a second and third life for every physical resource, increasing its lifetime value
and delaying its journey to the landfill. But it's not just about reusing things. If we're going to sustain
this connected flow of circular products and materials, we're going to have to build
the operational capacity in recycling, remanufacturing and reuse. And we're going to need things
like repair shops and training programs
like Arne Duncan’s Chicago CRED, where they're upskilling at-risk youth
on the South Side of Chicago. Or the circular construction laboratory
at Cornell University, where they're training the next generation
of eco-conscious architects. With greater capacity,
we can reduce the green premium or cost associated
with reuse and recycling. And we're going to need more local hubs like the Lifecycle Building
Center in Atlanta, where building materials can be donated
and reused in the community. And we’re going to need
more refurbishment companies like The Furniture X-Change in New Jersey
or Envirotech in Ontario, where they take old furniture and make something modern and appealing. And of course, we're going to need more
local shipping and delivery companies. Last but very importantly, we're going to have to match these digital
and operational infrastructure investments with smart public policy that incentivizes participation
in a circular economic model. In San Francisco, the Department of Environment
has adopted ordinances and solutions that drive
local circularity and reuse. Last November, Massachusetts made it illegal
to throw out textiles, becoming the very first state to do so. They've even launched a website
that maps out all the recycling outlets where these materials can be discarded. And in San Antonio,
one of my personal favorites, you don't pay property taxes
for five years if you rehab a building
in a local historic district. Now, here's where it's exciting
for public policymakers. A circular city could be
a thriving economy. Businesses in these
city-based circular economies are going to need large local workforces
to update internet infrastructure, to repair or remanufacture goods or just to resell and drive
things across town. Now these ideas
are getting a lot of traction. Last year, Rheaply,
with many other organizations, formed the Circular City Coalition
led by Pyxera Global. The Coalition's purpose
is to help any city transition from linear to circular, while making sure it benefits everyone
in the community equally. And here's where I get excited, and I think you all should, too. If we can summon the focus and energy to build just 1,000
of these circular cities by 2040, we'll drive down global greenhouse
gas emissions by more than 60 percent and get back on track
to meeting the targets set out in the Paris Accords. Yes. (Applause) We've got to do it. I'm a city boy from Chicago. And I know you love your city, too. Cities are ground zero in the fight
against global climate change. And in that fight, we're all neighbors, not competitors, not strangers. We need each other in whatever city or town we reside in. And if we can all just participate
in making our cities circular, sharing resources locally
when we no longer need them, a concept that simple, then a net-zero future is possible. Thank you. Thank you, TED. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #supplychain","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'sustainability', 'business', 'manufacturing', 'Audacious Project', 'trees', 'Resources', 'Nicole Rycroft']",2023-07-17T04:00:27-07:00,2023-07-17T04:00:27-07:00,Science & Technology,"Perhaps it's surprising that as
a professional tree hugger, I'm going to be speaking to
you about supply chains. They don’t sound very sexy, but
when it comes to stabilizing our climate, supply chains are the
hottest topic on the planet. And that's because more than half of our
society's carbon footprint can be attributed to the impact of supply
chains and specifically the raw materials that products
are made from. We have built our societies around 
take-make-waste production systems: the fossil fuel industry, plastics,
industrial forestry and paper. These are massive global supply chains
that have shaped our world. They've left deep scars across landscapes, legacies of pollution and push species and
cultures to the brink of extinction. Now, on the other hand, we have
game changing solutions, brilliant innovations that use 90 percent
less water and 50 percent less energy. But they’re stuck at small scale
because they can’t secure the financing that they need
to commercialize nor the markets that underpin their success. It's the classic chicken
and egg situation. And even with slow progress, we're losing ground to the climate
crisis and biodiversity loss. This at a moment when we need all
hands on deck for our planet. We must scale solutions and we
must scale them quickly. And this is not just about doing
less bad. That time has passed. We need the 2.0 industrial revolution, one that sets us on course to
operate and live within the natural bounds of our planet. And so overhauling 
these huge and powerful, entrenched industrial systems, 
it can appear daunting. But I've seen how change can
be successful up close with the work that I’ve been doing for the
past 20 years. For my organization, Canopy, our focus is on protecting
the world’s ancient and endangered forests and transforming
the massive pulp paper packaging and viscose supply chains. But the principles from those supply
chains can be applied to any sector in need of change. Keeping forests standing
is one of the fastest, cheapest, most effective ways for us
to stabilize our climate. But of course, 
we can’t keep forests standing if we keep mowing them down to make
pizza boxes and rayon T-shirts. The surge in e-commerce and fashion
derived from tree-based textiles like rayon and viscose is driving the destruction 
of climate-critical forests and creating mountains of discarded
textiles and packaging. We must move our supply chains out of
forest ecosystems, and to do that, we need to change the business practices
of thousands of brands. And that's where we come in. Canopy works to create
the market conditions for change by working with hundreds of the
forest industry’s largest customers. First to eliminate the use of ancient and endangered forest fiber from their
packaging and their textile supply chains. And now increasingly to introduce lower
carbon circular Next Gen alternatives. Get rid of the bad, phase
in, scale up the good. These companies are often
fierce competitors in the rest of their business operations, but they’re willing to come together
in a pre-competitive space because they know that no single company,
no matter how large they are, can transform an entire supply
chain by themselves, nor can they solve the climate crisis. And the CEOs 
of these companies’ suppliers, giant companies responsible for 90 percent
of global viscose production and half of packaging, can sit around
a single boardroom table. Imagine that. The outsized influence of
this small group of suppliers can unlock ambitious levels of change through
their collective supply chains. And of course, the same can be said
for other sectors as well. Supply chain transformation
starts when you have a critical mass of brands telling their
suppliers that they need to change, that they have 
zero tolerance for packaging and textiles that originate from
the world's endangered forests, that they want lower carbon, circular, Next Gen alternatives and
giving their suppliers a short timeline to achieve that target. And this strong market pull through
for low carbon alternative creates the value proposition for 
conventional producers to change business-as-usual practice, 
to fund the new tech, to develop the systems to replace tree
fiber with these low carbon, more circular feedstocks like discarded
clothing and agricultural residues, and then to build the systems to make sure
that these new feedstocks can then make their way to the new
Next Gen pulp mills. At Canopy, we call this strategy
“Survival: A pulp thriller.” (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So industry leaders demand
change, suppliers respond. It creates value that moves investment. The pipeline of solutions is buoyed, and you have a supply chain well on
its way to sustainable change. Canopy’s early work greening the Harry Potter book series has grown
to working with brands that represent $1 trillion. These companies are
changing the packaging and the viscose textiles that they're buying
based on the environmental qualities, and it is this leverage that has enabled
us to shift more than half of global viscose out of the world's ancient
and endangered forests. (Applause and cheers) And now we're working with our brand
partners, with conventional producers, with investors and with brilliant
innovators to scale climate resilient supply chains for the 21st century. And in fact, the world’s first Next Gen
mill is now up and running. It's a giant industrial mill
built in the bones of an old shuttered wood mill
in northern Sweden. And rather than requiring huge swaths
of forest to be cut every year, Renewcell will use hundreds of millions
of old jeans and T-shirts. It's re-employed 100 people. It uses 90 percent less water 
and five tons less carbon per ton of product compared
to a conventional tree-based rayon. Renewcell is a spectacular swords
to ploughshares example and it is the first of hundreds of
Next Gen mills that are on track to be operational by 2030 as our strategy unfolds and boosted by the
generous support of the TED community. It’s heartening and remarkable to see the viscose supply chain 
transforming in real time and proving that solutions
are indeed sexy. But it mustn't stop there because
many of our production systems and supply chains are unsustainable
and in need of change. The food system, plastics,
paper-based packaging. For every sector, there is a more
sustainable path forward and the solutions and the people needed to make them happen 
are often closer than we think. When we create 
the right market conditions, change can happen
exponentially and quickly. Carbon intensive supply chains are
relics of the 20th century. Let’s leave them back there. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #Detroit","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'sustainability', 'cities', 'social change', 'community', 'United States', 'infrastructure', 'Countdown', 'equality', 'investing', 'Anika Goss']",2023-07-14T05:37:25-07:00,2023-07-14T05:37:25-07:00,Nonprofits & Activism,"I’m a third-generation Detroiter. My grandmother moved to Detroit in 1936 during the Great Migration and brought all
of her Southern ways with her. She had an abundant garden with flowers for butterflies
and honeybees and birds. She preferred to take the bus
to Eastern Market to purchase all of her meat
just to make sure that it was fresh. She owned a home on Mendota Street and knew that home ownership
would create wealth and opportunity for her growing family. My family's story is not
an unusual Detroit story, and up until the late 1950s, Detroit was a haven
for middle-class families living in neighborhoods
where there was green space and community connectivity
and opportunity. But my grandmother's Detroit
is not the Detroit that I live in today. The Detroit today is not sustainable. 84 percent of Detroiters
identify as Black or Latino, and five percent are foreign-born. That makes this not just
a climate and economic issue but an equity issue. And I know this because I have spent my entire career focused on the intersection
between race and poverty. More recently, the work I do
with my colleagues focuses on how climate impacts
neighborhoods and communities that are isolated
from economic prosperity. Being financially secure
and climate resilient should be the most important priority
for communities across the country. That is what I want to talk
with you about today. Detroit is not generally
thought of as a city that is at risk for climate impact, but in fact it is. We define resilience as places
where residents can have their needs met and are free from long-term
chronic stress, giving them the ability to withstand
and recover from acute shocks. If you are financially stable, then you are much more likely
to withstand and recover from the acute shock of climate change. Detroit's economic inequity
and climate vulnerability began over 100 years ago under the guise of innovation. Detroit not only
led the way for automobiles but manufacturing. Manufacturing was a part
of our community fabric. Industrial sites were nestled
in neighborhoods throughout the city so that workers could walk
to their factory jobs. Our economy was booming. And although Detroit was not necessarily
equal across racial lines, it was still a city of stable,
middle-class neighborhoods. In 75 years, our city went from a peak
population of 1.8 million down to a population of 620,000 in 2022. All of those sites
where there was manufacturing and industrial sites that led
to our economic boom, many of those industrial sites
stand vacant and abandoned. We now have about 19 square miles
of vacant land in Detroit. These industrial sites have led
to dangerous contamination, both to our land
and our water and our air. About two years ago, eight inches of rain fell over Detroit
over a period of three days. And not just Detroit,
but southeast Michigan. Scientists describe this
as a more-than-500-year rain event. Now, eight inches of rain
doesn't seem like a lot of rain, but this one rain event
flooded our streets. Basements became filled
with storm water and sewage. The repair costs were insurmountable
for many families, and with nearly half
of Detroiters renting, it often led to homelessness. Climate change exacerbates and compounds economic inequity in our city. But I believe there are three
things that we can do to begin to change
the resilient future for Detroit. First, we have to begin to create
an economic environment in which all Detroiters can grow wealth. Advanced technology
and tech-based businesses are the fastest-growing industries
in Detroit, but also the nation. It's these businesses that will contribute
to solving our climate dilemma and make millions,
even billions, doing it. But unless we include
Black and brown Detroiters, both as workers and investing in founders, we will leave our largest
demographic out of our future. Second, we have to stop only responding when there’s a crisis situation,
like flooding and air quality control, and begin to think about green
stormwater infrastructure and solar and renewable
energy proactively. I was having this
conversation with my sister because that's what sisters do, talk about manufacturing
and infrastructure investment. This is my sister, I have two of them. So she lives in Washington, DC. Eight inches of rain, in her opinion, was just not enough rain
to create that much flooding. And she kind of didn't believe me that Detroit was at risk
for climate impacts. And I explained to her that Detroit
is not different from other cities in its process for making municipal
investment decisions. Municipal investment decisions
are made for primarily two ways: new development and crisis repair. Detroit is not unique. What makes Detroit unique is it has 100-year-old gray infrastructure supporting 139 square miles of Detroit. We can no longer only
make decisions for crisis. We don't have that luxury. We have to make decisions differently to improve the quality
of life for Detroiters and improve the quality
of the neighborhoods that we're all living in for the future. Finally, we have to begin
to invest in neighborhoods so that they are free
from blight and deterioration. As an urbanist and a futurist, I want to help Detroiters imagine
the city they deserve to live in. You shouldn't have to live in a suburb
to be surrounded by beautiful gardens, parks and trees. We can plant urban forests here. (Applause) So that we can reduce urban heat-island
impacts and improve air quality. We can plant sustainable gardens
and food gardens just like the ones
you are seeing on the screen, that my team and community partners
have planted all over Detroit. We can do this. We have to do this. And we need to do this because investing in neighborhoods, not just as a social program, but we must do this because climate equity
and climate economics require investment
in order to see the actual results. This is true, not only
in this nation's largest Black city, but in every city
where inequality is on the rise and climate equity will surely follow. My grandmother's house still stands on
Mendota long after she passed away. Her expectation of me and of you is that a Black family just like mine that migrated north 90 years ago will be able to prosper 90 years from now because they are economically thriving. Their neighborhood has parks, gardens,
trees and community spaces. And they are still Black. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'media', 'social change', 'communication', 'personal growth', 'self', 'social media', 'Internet', 'Taylor Cassidy']",2023-08-17T04:00:38-07:00,2023-08-17T04:00:38-07:00,Science & Technology,"In my life, I have always been
attracted to two things. One, filming videos. I would always grab the family camera and film these dramatic stories
with my little bitty toys. And on the other hand, my parents were always
making it a priority for me to learn Black history, because they knew that it wasn't going
to be a priority in my school's education. So from a very young age,
I developed the sense of voice, creativity and my message. I'm Taylor Cassidy. I’m a social media content creator and today, I want to share with you why social media virality doesn’t have
the impact that you might think. So we're going to go over
to my high school years. It was 2020, and a new app
just came out, called TikTok, and all the cool kids were getting on it. And I'm a cool kid,
so I got on it as well, and I thought, ""This is amazing. This is a time for me to combine
the two things that I absolutely love and put them into one."" And so that's exactly what I did. Sitting on my bedroom floor
on the first day of Black History Month, I created my first
Fast Black History video, where I talked about a Black figure
in 60 seconds or less, and I posted it. And it went viral, y'all. Wow. It went viral. And, I mean, thousands of people
were looking at this video and seeing this message. And I was so excited,
because the passion that I had, the passion that I had for Black history, people were loving it,
and spreading it as well. And so I continued to do it. I continued the Fast Black History series and along with other videos,
I grew my account. I got 200K followers, yeah.
500K, whoo. A million followers. What? Like ... Wow. (Laughs) And when you look at these numbers, I wonder if you think to yourself, ""Wow, this girl, Taylor Cassidy,
is so impressive."" And I thank y'all so much. But -- (Laughs) I also want to ask you, even though you might look
at these numbers and see, like ... ""Millions of people are watching her,
she must have a great impact."" Let me ask you,
would you think the same thing if I told you I only talked
to a thousand people a day? What about 500? What about one? Now while you think about this,
I'll take you to February of 2021. And it was one year after I started
my Fast Black History series. And I thought to myself, ""Man, if that many people
looked at my videos last year, they're all going to come back, right?
I mean, probably even more so. Who wouldn't want
to support this message?"" And so I pulled out all of the stops. I got a green screen, I got costumes, I got an external video maker. I went bougie with it. (Laughter) And I created my first
Fast Black History video for 2021, and I posted it. And in the end, I was disappointed. I mean, where did everybody go? There weren't half as many people watching
as there were last year. What was wrong? And mind you, there were still thousands
of people watching my videos. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was that my mindset
was so focused on those numbers that I thought to myself, if millions of people
weren't watching my videos, did my message even really matter
that much in the first place? And because of this,
a deep insecurity developed in me, and I started drastically
changing my content to try and adhere to trends,
to try and make it go more viral ... And, I mean, it worked. I had many viral videos after that. But why, whenever I looked at my account, why, whenever I looked at my own videos, did I not feel fulfilled? And it took this one video that I posted. It was a motivational video, and, I mean, I had posted them before
and I still post them. They're so much fun. But there was this one video ... And I filmed it, posted it, and it went viral -- 600K views, yes. But after a while,
I privated it, I took it down. Because whenever you looked
into the comments, it was only spam, random emojis and fake accounts commenting on the post. But not only this. I knew that whenever
I looked back at that video, the pep-talk sentences
that I was giving ... meant nothing to me. They weren't connected to me, and I knew that they were just buzzwords
that I was using for virality. And in the end, I didn't feel inspired. I felt sleazy. And that moment took me down
a very important and long journey of understanding
that social media virality doesn't always mean impact. 2020. We had a pandemic. All of our social avenues were taken away. The way that we use our voice,
they way that we interact, was completely changed. And so we all flocked to social media. And in fact, TikTok in particular had
an 800 percent increase in users by August of 2020. That's crazy. That means that it's easier than ever to have millions of people
listen to what you have to say with the click of a button. But that notion, that desire for our virality, has changed the way we think
about the definition of impact. Who's a Gen Z out here? Raise your hand. Let me see y'all. Hey, I see y'all. We grew up with this notion of fame. We know what instantaneous
fame looks like. We know it, and I'll prove it to you. Look at the TV shows
that we used to watch. ""Shake it Up"" is about
two girls dancing ... But they're famous. ""iCarly"" is about a group of friends,
you know, making funny skits. But they're famous. ""Hannah Montana,"" this one is about just a regular girl
going to school... but she’s famous. (Laughter) And because of this --
I bring this up because we've grown up believing
that the highest point of achievement, accomplishment and impact must be achieved through fame, right? But that makes it all the more hard for somebody who doesn't have
a big following to believe that their voice
and their perspective matter, because we've grown up believing that the bigger the following,
the bigger the impact. But those two things don't add up. Or, as TikTok users would say,
""the math ain't mathing."" (Laughter) But what if I told you that you have
the power to change the world even if you just impact one person? I’ll show you how. Let’s get into it. Have a clear message and goal,
and then stick by it. Here's an example. This is a journal entry that I wrote
at the beginning of my TikTok career, and I basically wrote down
what TikTok meant to me, what I wanted to do with it,
and what my goal was. And in doing this,
I gave myself a mission statement, so that if I ever got lost
or frustrated, or confused, I had something to come back to. And even to this day, I come back to this and I abide by these same themes. Now, for you, what that means is this is the part
where you cement in yourself that your perspective is needed and that it matters. And even if somebody else is doing
the same thing that you're doing, or talking about the same message
that you want to talk about, you stay steady and share it anyway, because your perspective
and the way that you have developed, and developed your voice in this world, nobody else has done it like you have, and that is your superpower. Alright, we've got our message,
we're sticking by it. Now we need to check
where your resolve is placed. What is resolve? Resolve is the characteristic
that helps you to keep on going towards your goal, even when there are
inconveniences or discomforts. It's what helps you to watch
that one more Netflix episode, even though your eyes are falling asleep. It's what helps you to keep on
doing your homework, Georgetown, even when you don't feel like doing it. It's what keeps you going. And I say ""check
where your resolve is placed,"" because in sharing your message or goal, it is so easy to fall into putting it into seeing how many people
you can get in front of you, seeing how many people you can reach. And in doing that,
you sacrifice your message and exploit it for fame and popularity. Instead, place your resolve in knowing that you have the very ability
to impact one person and change their life, because you have the ability
to change the world ... But you also have the ability
to impact one person who has the ability
to change the world as well. And that is still so cool. OK, you may be thinking,
""Taylor, alright, I've got my message, I'm sticking by it,
I know where my resolve is placed. So why in the world,
whenever I post a video on Instagram, it doesn't even get 10 likes? Why is that?"" And I'll tell you, even though there might not be
millions of people looking at your video, you really don’t know
who is going to stop on it and truly take to heart
the words that you have to say. And that brings me to my last point. Focus on the impact of one. You see my transition? Yeah. I’ll give you more examples. 
You know I come with the receipts. These comments
are from videos that I posted, where somebody was inspired by them or inspired by my account to go out
and make a change in their own life. And one of them even says
that they are going into their school and campaigning for more
Black history to be taught, the very message that I wanted
to share in the first place. And I show you
these specific comments because every single one of them came from videos that a lot of people
consider flopped -- did not go viral, ""unsuccessful,"" failed. But that goes to show
that the videos that I posted weren’t defined by the millions of people
that did or didn’t look at them. They were defined
by the very ability that they had to reach out and impact one person to go and change their entire community. And that is so much more
valuable and sustaining than creating something
or sharing something just for the purpose
of getting quick virality. Alright. We've got our message, we've got our understanding that the individual impact
is just as important as reaching a thousand. So why is it so hard for us to share
our perspective and our voice? How is it so hard for us
to get over that fear? I'll tell you one more story before I go. [When] I was in high school,
I entered a short film competition where I made a short film
about a young Black girl going through school and finding
her own identity as a Black woman in the midst of stereotypes
being pushed on her by her peers and her classmates. And in doing this, I was so scared, because it was a story
that I had went through, was a very personal story of mine, but I pushed on anyway. Here are some stills from the film. “Oh my gosh, Hayley Cassidy
is just like Issa Rae.” Wow! Thank you, I appreciate it. But I was so scared to make this film,
but I pushed on anyway. And at the film festival, [when] they were showing
all of the competitors’ films, afterwards, a girl came up to me, and basically said to me how much
she related with the main character, how much she understood
what the main character went through, and she thanked me for making
something that connected with her and helped her to feel seen. And in that moment, I understood something
very, very important. If I had let my fear of embarrassment,
my fear of failure, or my fear of lack
of a reaction from people, stop me from spreading this message, I would have never been able to give someone the permission
to let go of their own fear. For you, what that means is that the passion,
the urgency and the love that you have for your idea
and your message must be greater than your fear. And notice how I said ""greater than,"" and not that fear will be nonexistent. Because the very fact
that fear and anxiety are associated with your message is proof that it has the power
to change everything. So, as you go on into your life, maybe you'll go into business, maybe you'll go into art. Maybe you'll become
a Twitch streamer, I don't know. They make a lot of good money. Remember to keep steady in your message. Protect your voice from being distorted
by gaining popularity and fame, and understand and focus
on the individual impact of one. Know that your perspective, the way you act
and interact in this world, is the key to changing it. I believe in you. Keep rising. Thank you so much."

#TED #TEDTalks #food","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED']",2023-07-27T08:31:37-07:00,2023-07-27T08:31:37-07:00,People & Blogs,"Lindsay Levin: Great to be here with you. And you started your career at Nestlé in a beverage factory in Suffolk,
Virginia, I believe, way back when. And today you run
the largest business division of the world's largest food company. Give us a sense of what that means. Steve Presley: Yeah,
obviously, as you said, Nestlé is the world's
largest food company. It's also one of the largest food
and beverage companies in North America. And I would bet the majority
of the people in the room have a Nestlé product in your house. We're actually in 95 percent
of the households in the US with one of our brands. And if you think about our brands, most people know us through our brands
DiGiorno, Stouffer's, Hot Pockets, Starbucks at home, Coffee-mate
or any of our Purina petcare products. And so we have a really broad,
vast portfolio of products. And as we work across that,
how do we bring that to life? And we bring it to life with 30,000
amazing team members around the country that are spread around 119 facilities
in 28 different states that really are focused
on trying to make our business and the contributions to the society
much better every single day. But if you kind of step back
at a global level, we actually sell a billion Nestlé
products every single day in 188 countries around the world. So massive scale. And to do that, we work directly
with 500,000 farmers around the world, directly and indirectly over a million. LL: So that's a lot
of responsibility, right? We think about food,
we think about farming, we think about the responsibility
of the agricultural industry in terms of soil, in terms of water, in terms of emissions. Give us a sense of the challenges
that you're now seeking to address as you think forward in terms
of farming and food. SP: Sure. I mean, look,
food production in total accounts for about 30 percent
of total greenhouse gas emissions. And at the core of that is agriculture. And for us, that's why regenerative
agriculture is so important. For us to continue to make progress
on our net-zero commitment, we actually have to see these farming
practices adopted at more scale. And when you think about that, it's easy to say and it's very hard to do. Just take it to the US level alone. There’s two million farms in the US, and for us, we source
over 2,600 agricultural ingredients from thousands of farms
across the country. And within that 2,600, every single crop
has a different challenge to actually get to regenerative practices. Carrots are different from apples
which are different from dairy which are different from beef. And so the complexity and scale of that challenge
across that is incredible because it's not just one solution
that can be applied. And secondly, as we talk
to our farming partners, we really talk to our
suppliers to understand. They're incredibly interested
in this journey. We try to put ourselves
in the farmers' shoes. Imagine if this is
a multigenerational farm, and you're the farmer
that's changing the way you've farmed the soil
for hundreds of years, and now there's a better way to do it. It's incredible risk. That's where I think for us as Nestlé, we feel like we have to play
and share in that risk. And we approach it in this idea
of creating shared value. And everybody says creating shared value. But for us, it has to be good for Nestlé. We’re a for-profit company
and a publicly traded company, and what we do is focused
around being good for us. But at the same time, we want it
to be good for the farmers, good for our suppliers,
good for our consumers and ultimately good for the planet. LL: Tell us about the goals
you’ve set for the company. How ambitious are you trying to be,
how do you prioritize? SP: Yeah, look, for us on the goals, we have a net-zero commitment by 2050,
which seems like a long time away, but as we all know, it's tomorrow. And if we haven't already started making
progress against that, we're in trouble. And we're quite proud of the fact that the progress we made
in the last couple of years, we're actually beyond peak carbon and so we're reducing carbon
as we move ahead. So we’re very focused on that. And we really approach it
in kind of four key pillars. We approach it with ingredients
that I'll talk quite a bit about today, we approach it on packaging,
manufacturing, the conversion process, and then last, the local
communities that we serve. And if I can just quickly on each one. In ingredients, you think about it, regenerative agriculture has to come
to all those in a way that brings sustainable change. And so we’re very focused on that. And we have to do it
across every single bucket, whether it's wheat, rice, corn. And we've got teams and programs
focused across all of those categories. And for us, we've committed to be
50 percent regenerative-sourced by 2030. We're well on our way on that journey. If you think about packaging, we're very proud of the progress
we've made in packaging. We've reduced over
half a million tons of plastic from our existing packaging today, with so much more to go on that journey. And then if you think about the manufacturing
conversion process, we committed to 100 percent renewable
electricity across all of our facilities, and we're actually well on the way
on that, we're at 50 percent. We've been able to reduce our scope
to emissions around that already. We're invested in two massive
solar farms in Texas that have allowed us to do that,
and we continue to push that forward. All of our factories in the US actually
are zero waste to landfill already today. And then lastly is in the local
farming communities. And when we talk
about working with the farmers, just a couple examples. You know, if you think about the work we do
in the Côte d’Ivoire on cocoa farmers, really it's providing financial incentives
directly to the farmers to actually encourage these practices and at the same time encourage
child education and agroforestry work. So that's just kind of how we think
about how we prioritize across the list. LL: Now, I want to take you back
to this term “regenerative farming,” because it seems to me
this is one of these things everybody's going to self-define
and then we kind of dumb it down and we don't really know
what we're talking about. What what do you mean by that? And how do you hold
yourself to a standard? SP: I'm sure there have been
much better speakers and much smarter people
in the course of this session that have actually defined it
more eloquently than I have. But when I look at it,
ultimately at the end of every crop cycle, have we improved the soil
and the biodiversity of the resources we use to produce those? And if we have, then we're moving
forward in regenerative farming. And it's incredibly powerful. And it sounds a bit academic
or maybe a little far out there, but really when you get down to it, some of the practices
are simple as crop rotation, live root farming, low-till, no-till. And those are relatively
easy to implement. Still different and challenging
for the farmers. All the way to multimillion-dollar
installations of manure systems that actually can reduce
greenhouse gases on dairy farms. And so the scale and complexity
of the application of solutions is very different as we work through that. LL: And what are you doing to actually
advance those practices? SP: You know, when we think about it, I think the best way to bring it to life
is maybe focus it on a product. And we're in Detroit,
which is a great pizza city. And so let's talk about pizza. Every great pizza
starts with a great crust and the crust in DiGiorno,
we're making an announcement today, where we're investing
in over 100,000 acres of wheat farming in the US
with our partners to be able to produce enough wheat to double the production
required for DiGiorno pizza. And so we'll have regenerative
wheat through that. And then you move to the tomatoes. Today, it’s not about getting more farms
to actually move to regenerative practice, and tomatoes, the majority of our tomatoes
are already regeneratively farmed. And so it's about external verification. So we're working with an external firm
called Leading Harvest that's actually help us not only just, one, we’ve already
got the farmers doing it, but how do we verify it over time,
how do we continue to do that? So we work through the tomatoes and I think really good
progress in that space. And then when you go to dairy, dairy is one of the toughest ones
and we're quite proud, we were the first company to join
the US Dairy Net Zero Initiative, and we have live farms
working in California today or around the country today that are really focused
on applying these practices that can get to net zero
emission for a dairy farm and at the same time, is it economically
viable for the farmer? And we're really proud
of the progress we're making with some of our farming
partners out there. And then the last one is meat, and we all love a good pepperoni
or topping on the pizza. And when you go to meat,
we actually have the largest partnership, it's early days, we're just
moving ahead with it, but the largest private
partnership with Cargill and the National Wildlife
and Fish Foundation to actually have regenerative
ranching practices in over 15 states. So as you kind of think through the pizza, you can see that it touches
every single component, and every single one
is a different application and solution. LL: So there's a lot
and this is difficult. Where are you not moving
fast enough yet? SP: Where are we not moving fast enough? You know, for us, I think clearly, when you go to try
to drive this kind of scale, it's not about one farm. It's about the farming ecosystem
in total that has to change. So we need to move at scale
to be able to do this across not just our business, but if we're really going
to move the needle, we have to do it at industry level. And so I think just the pace of the change where we'd love to see
that move a little faster. I think secondly maybe is in packaging, when I look at packaging
and recyclability, we know the recycling infrastructure
is woefully insufficient in the US. It's why we've leaned in
pretty aggressively. We’ve invested with partners like
Closed Loop to support infrastructure, and also we support kind of responsible
extended producer responsibility to actually help build that because we know that we can't make all
the recyclable products we want. There is no infrastructure to do it. So at the end of the day,
it doesn't get done. And so I'd say that's an area
where we're really focused. And just lastly, I think
the tempo and urgency across the entire industry complex
is one that we've got to pick up the pace. We've got to move much, much faster,
not just to achieve our goals, but to make the kind of difference
we want to make. LL: So just to close, Steve, what can
and should we expect from you all? SP: Look, I think you'll continue to see
incredible commitment. By 2025, we will have invested
3.6 billion dollars in these practices across the world for Nestlé. It's an incredible investment
but we believe it's the right investment, because ultimately,
when you look at our business, we're a food and beverage business that we make products for you
and your families and your pets to enjoy every single day. And those start with great ingredients. And that investment for us
is actually about a business decision that, we've been around
for over 150 years, if we're going to be around
for the next 150, we need to make sure we have great quality
ingredients for that period. And so that investment actually
helps us ensure that. So what you can count on is we'll continue to drive that
across all of our complexes. But most importantly, what I'm proud of, is you can count on the company
and all the people that work in it. There's 30,000 in North America
and there's almost 300,000 worldwide that are absolutely committed
to making progress every single day against one of those commitments. SP: Steve, thank you
very much for joining us. SP: Thanks for having me. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #work","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'business', 'psychology', 'work', 'motivation', 'work-life balance']",2023-09-13T13:00:11-07:00,2023-09-13T13:00:11-07:00,People & Blogs,"In 2019, I was working from my laptop,
from a beautiful beach in Bali. Drinking water right out
of a fresh coconut and enjoying the warm ocean breeze, and I'm thinking, meh. Something was still missing,
and I couldn’t put my finger on it. How could I be in this scenario
and not feel fulfilled? I worked from 12 countries
in 12 months that year. An opportunity that was once rare
is now more possible for more people than ever before. Spotify recently introduced their new
""work from anywhere"" policy in which they're giving employees
a choice of working wherever they do their most focused
and creative thinking. Dropbox's new way of working
is called ""Virtual first,"" in which remote work will be
the primary experience for employees, saving in-person meetings
for special occasions. And that's great news because over 50 percent of people
that work remotely say that if their current company
doesn't give them some type of remote work option long-term, they'll look for a job
at a company that does. Well, problem solved, right? Except what people are saying
and what they're doing is inconsistent. In fact, according
to a recent McKinsey study, workplace flexibility wasn't even one
of the top five reasons people quit their jobs in the past year. More freedom at work
doesn't mean more fulfillment. Let me take you back to the end of 2018. I'm two years into doing my job
as the director of talent development for a New York-based tech company. And I'm doing what I love to do the most, creating and launching employee
development programs from scratch. And then my boss says to me, ""Next year is going to be
the year of maintenance, focusing on refining existing programs
instead of launching new ones."" I'm not a maintenance-mode person. While I understand its importance,
it's really not where I shine, so I wasn't looking forward
to the year ahead. Meanwhile, I was reading new research
on the future of work, and all signs were pointing
to a remote and hybrid-work future. We now know that the pandemic
accelerated that by at least a decade. I even found a work-and-travel program that coordinates a group of professionals
to work remotely from around the world with coworking spaces and living
accommodations in each city. I was immediately hooked. I had always wanted to travel
for a longer period of time, but I thought I'd have to quit my job
in order to do that. Then I thought, well, I could do
maintenance mode from anywhere. And given my current company's
global expansion plans, I knew I had to think about where current
and future employees could be located. If I could convince my company
that I should work remotely to better understand the opportunities and challenges that remote workers face, it could be a win-win for both of us. And a month later,
I ended my apartment lease, sold my furniture and hopped on a one-way flight
from cold and snowy New York City to Lima, Peru, to start my year-long trip with my cohort. And let me tell you, those first few months were incredible. I attended a virtual team meeting
for my coworking space at Lima before heading out to go surfing
at sunset on a regular Tuesday. I launched a work program
from inside of a pool in Puerto Escondido, Mexico. And I negotiated a contract
from a cafe in Hanoi, Vietnam, before jumping on the back of a motorbike
to go eat bun cha with friends. I met remote workers and digital
nomads from around the world. Each of us had a different story
of how we got there. Some had just been divorced
or gotten out of long-term relationships and convinced their employers
to let them work remotely so that they could get away. There were three corporate lawyers
who all hated their jobs and thought that doing them from a beach
would make it more tolerable. And some just wanted to be as far away
from micromanagement and office politics as possible. But still, after a few months, when that honeymoon period was over
and the novelty faded, we realized that traveling was just
a Band-Aid solution for the real problems. I wondered, how could we get
this ""work from anywhere"" life right? So I interviewed dozens of remote workers, I conducted a focus group,
and I surveyed hundreds of people. And you know what I saw in all that data? Wherever you go, there you are. If you hate your job in Houston,
you will hate it in Hanoi. What really needs fixing
is your motivation to do the work itself. We believe we need
a certain amount of money to create or maintain
the lifestyle that we've envisioned. We think we need a specific job title
that aligns with the identity that we or our parents imagined
for us a decade ago. And we don't realize that we get stuck in the motions of work routines
without intention. Minimizing these pressures
around your money, identity and routines and focusing on opportunities
for more growth, impact and joy is the key to a more fulfilling career
no matter where you're located. And the good news is that you might
not have to overhaul your career or life to feel fulfilled. Esther Perel, world-renowned
psychotherapist and couples counselor, says that in the West today, most of us are going to have two or three
marriages or committed relationships, and some of us are going to do it
with the same person. Think about that for a second. She's saying that some of us will build
and experience a new relationship with the same person. Perhaps something similar could be said
about your relationship to your work at the same company. Perhaps after a challenging time,
an enticing external offer or having been together for a while, instead of breaking up, you could find and create
a better path forward together. And I'm not saying you're going to get
everything you want out of your current job, but given how much time
you spend working, isn't it worth a shot to make it
as fulfilling as possible? When the pandemic hit
and much of the world went remote, I saw my corporate friends in the States follow the exact same trajectory
that we did abroad. The thrill of working home
in your pajamas, having more flexibility
with your schedule, being able to do the laundry
in between meetings, all of which can make a real difference
in improving your daily life. But still, once the novelty faded
and the reality set in, people had to face whatever
underlying issues they'd had before the pandemic started. When the perks of an office job
were taken away, whether it was the free snacks
in the break room, the water-cooler conversation
with colleagues, what people were left with
was the work itself and their motivation,
or lack thereof, to do it. And they began to ask themselves
really important questions: Do I even like my job? Is this really worth my time? Is this what I want to be doing? And these are great questions to ask. The problem is, for way too many people, they thought they had to completely
overhaul their career or life. More people voluntarily
quit their jobs in 2021 than any other year in recorded history. They wanted a fresh start and a new
beginning after a challenging time. Here's the kicker, though. Almost 50 percent of the people
that did find jobs after quitting say that their new job has not lived up
to their expectations. They found out, just like we did
in Peru, Mexico and Vietnam, that wherever you go, there you are. Perhaps you could start
the next chapter of your career in an organization that knows you, where you've built credibility
and trust and a network, and where they'd be willing to let you
try things you haven't done before. Now, I'm not saying you should stay
in a toxic work environment. And sometimes you do need
a larger-scale change, like a new job or a new career. But before you make a decision
that you think will make you happier, I want you to consider that happiness
is a feeling that doesn't last. It often is what we want in the moment
and depends on external circumstances. What does last, however, is fulfillment. Fulfillment is richer,
deeper and longer-term and often takes a longer amount of time
and intention to get it. As you look to generate fulfillment, I want you to consider three questions
tied to three of its key components that are more internally driven. The first is joy. What kind of work energizes you
that you'd love to do more of? Now, I want you to remember that just
because you're good at something, it doesn't mean that you enjoy doing it. So really consider what gives you
a deep feeling of contentment. Next is impact. How could you provide more value
to your company or clients by doing this kind of work? And if you're having trouble answering
that question, then ask your manager, your peers or clients directly. Focus on work that's in that sweet spot of meeting both your interests
and the client's needs or the business needs. And finally, growth. Which knowledge or skills could you
develop through these experiences? Feeling a sense of progress
toward meaningful work is one of the biggest
drivers of fulfillment. I asked myself these same three questions
when I was feeling happy yet not fulfilled with my life
working from a beach. And I found out that I find
joy in interviewing, researching and talking to remote
workers about their lives. I made a significant impact
by facilitating workshops to help them develop
their skills and their careers. And growth came in the form
of me figuring out how to distill a career's worth
of the best HR advice and expertise into an easily digestible book
for remote workers. Thousands of organizations
around the world are finally understanding the importance of giving employees a choice
of where to work. And while being given that choice
is certainly meaningful, what’s even more empowering is the fulfillment that comes
from doing work that truly lights you up,
wherever you are. Thank you."

first-ever live stream map to monitor the industrial fishing fleet. When we were working with our 
partners in Japan and South Korea, they told us there was illegal fishing 
suspected in North Korean waters. But when we first took a 
look on our map, we could see very little fishing because those vessels 
were not sharing their GPS location data, as they should. We call them “dark vessels.” And generally, dark vessels are up to no good. So we had to turn to other sources of data. We looked at satellite-based radar and optical imagery, and we lit that region up. We revealed an armada 
of almost 1,000 vessels. The techniques we used to illuminate 
what was happening in North Korea, we can use anywhere and everywhere to make the invisible visible. We can end pirate fishing. And we can transform ocean management for the common good of all."

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'social change', 'personal growth', 'society', 'social media']",2023-10-23T04:00:12-07:00,2023-10-23T04:00:12-07:00,Nonprofits & Activism,"As a writer and performer, for years, I have been known
for giving voice or voices to the many diverse characters
I play onstage and, more recently, in my film
“Sell/Buy/Date.” My characters, these characters,
some of whom you are about to meet, are based on people from my real life, including my very real mixed race family. Like me. My name is Lorraine. Hi there, TED. It's wonderful. I'm kvelling to be here
with you all again. Thank you for having me. Please don't AI me. (Laughter) So Lorraine is based partly
on a real relative of mine. But don't worry, I changed the names
to protect the innocent and especially the guilty. Claro que sí. Hi, I'm Nereida. Muy buenas tardes, everybody. I am also from Sarah Jones's family,
but I'm a little bit nervous because I was so excited
to come back here to TED, and then Sarah Jones was like, ""We are going to be talking about
how everyone is afraid of cancel culture."" And I was like, ""First of all, we are here speaking as people
from different backgrounds. Are we even allowed to do that anymore? Like what if people confuse
what we're doing with cultural appropriation, which is probably the fastest
way to get us all canceled? Oh, my God. No, thank you.” As you can hear, my characters
have their own take on things, but I had a very personal experience
of cancel culture, and I wanted to share about it here. And I’m hoping that if we’re willing
to really talk about all of this, maybe we can stop living in fear of it and get at what's actually underneath it. Now you’ve already met
Lorraine and Nereida ... But you haven’t met me. Hi, I'm Bella. She/her pronouns. I’m a double major,
feminism and philosophy, and actually social justice. Just auditing. (Laughter) But also I'm minoring in social media with a concentration
on notable TikTok memes. (Laughter) But as far as, like, cancel culture
with, like, older people ... I mean, like, not to say that,
like, you're all older, but, like, just some of you
are more, like, chronologically advanced ... (Laughter) people and, like, more successful, right? So, like, obvi, you have, like,
the most to lose, right? Um. So -- (Applause) Bella makes an annoying
but very good point, right? This is a global phenomenon with immeasurable impact
on culture, commerce. And I know, the feeling is
over the past few years, there has suddenly been this rise of a terrifying specter
that everybody has to fear. But in my experience, cancel culture
actually hasn't been sudden, and it is certainly not new. If the definition of being canceled is being silenced, excluded, disempowered and disinvited
from the larger conversation, then for many of us, cancel culture has defined our lives
for most of history. I mean, spoiler alert, I'm Black. Also a woman. I have Latino relatives. I'm even a little part Jewish. I know what it is to have cancellation
baked into who I am. So some of our experiences
down through history have amounted
to a kind of pre-cancellation. It's only now that this
new kind of cancellation has begun to impact
the powerful and dominant with the pre-canceled folk saying, ""Hey, this system has been failing
a lot of us for centuries. So now it's our turn. We're going to take justice
into our own hands and cancel you."" And I agree that we need the equity
and justice our laws promise but often don't deliver. For example, harmful
and even criminal behavior, when committed by powerful people, has often gone completely unpunished. And in situations like that, yeah, cancel culture can at least offer
some form of restitution. Now that said, as a system,
it's far from perfect. I mean, once people are canceled, how are we actually
holding them accountable? Like there are those creepy comedians or CEOs who might have to hole up
in their mansions for a little while. But before you know it, a lot of them
are right back in Madison Square Garden or otherwise in business. And meanwhile, the larger systems
that created them keep right on going. Now even worse, sometimes people who are the opposite
of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world can get lumped in and dragged as soon as one voice screams
“cancellation” in a crowded theater. I mentioned my film
""Sell/Buy/Date"" earlier. It was inspired by a play
of the same name. I even performed an early excerpt
of it right here at TED. And it’s a one-person show that explores
themes of women and sex and power through the lens of the sex industry. But if you don't know my work,
let me give you a little bit more context. Since I grew up watching
racial, ethnic and other stereotypes, or no images of us at all, my work has always been
about accurately portraying people in our full humanity. And in the case of ""Sell/Buy/Date,"" which was inspired by real people
in the sex industry whom I had spent years getting to know and who generously trusted me
with their stories onstage, I was grateful my work was received as a loving tribute
to those diverse people and ideas. That is, until the film version
was announced in the press. The film was backed by a team
of A-list Hollywood producers. And so suddenly
this was a much bigger platform. And people who did not know me
and my connection to the topic assumed I was a cultural appropriator
with bad intentions, and suddenly I was under brutal attack. I mean, strangers
from all over the internet were coming for me personally, threatening my funders, promising to cancel anyone
associated with my film. Why? Well, these cancelers were
actually concerned sex workers. They were afraid my film
would be disrespectful to the already very marginalized people
in the sex industry. And I get that. But before I could even make the film and include the voices of sex workers,
as I had always planned, they said I had no right to tell my story
since I'm not in the industry myself. And they were more than willing
to destroy me and my career. Ultimately, I hung in there. I made the film, which shows me
wrestling with these issues, and it was critically acclaimed
by the “New York Times.” But along the way, I, the film and the very people
it was trying to serve all suffered harm
that may never be undone. I've lost friendships and opportunities
that can never be restored. But even worse, the distraction
of the cancellation pulled focus from the goal of destigmatizing people
in the sex industry. And that is another huge problem
with cancel culture, is that at its worst it can end up hurting the very people
it's trying to help. And even at its best, it can still fuel
this continuous loop of fear. Like there are the marginalized folks
who fear very understandably that they'll be disempowered yet again. And then there are the people
who are in power and fear losing that power. Or they secretly feel
like they're being indicted rather than invited into a conversation. And nobody is really evolving
under circumstances like that. Meanwhile, the larger culture
of inequality not only isn't improving, it's actually getting worse out here because everybody's just reacting
from their amygdala. So ... What's the solution? Well, kind of like with my film, I'm not here to tell you
what you have to think. Yes, but I will listen. Even the nice Black girl is saying
cancel culture is not the solution. So I think we should all just say, ""Poo poo poo. Glad we cleared that up. We can all move on, thank God."" Yeah, well -- Yes but, Lorraine, it’s not that simple because many of us, you know, the pre-canceled people, we can't just move on without a more equitable,
a better society. The good news is, I believe that starts less
with looking at Twitter and more with, well, looking at the man in the mirror. At the risk of invoking
a very canceled pop icon, I'm sorry. Research shows that if we try
looking really honestly at ourselves and any biases or privilege we may have, it could actually improve
our quality of life. A recent piece in ""Scientific American""
about unlearning certain prejudices pointed to research that --
wait for this -- even with power, when the dominant group
fears losing that power, they are more anxious, more angry, defensive, paternalistic, which harms us all. So whether we're the ones
who fear being canceled or we're trying to hold others to account, we can all start a daily practice
of being self-accountable. To notice, without judgment,
any tendencies in ourselves that could be hurtful to others. And I'm not saying
that unlearning our biases will automatically
shield us from cancellation, but we can at least try to own
any mistakes we might be making. And we don’t have to do it alone. We can surround ourselves
with trusted people who may be more aware
of certain issues than we are. Think of them as
your own personal cancel counsel. (Laughter) Yeah? OK. Lastly, let’s say we’re the ones
doing the canceling. Looking honestly at ourselves
can keep us from automatically assuming the worst in people
who could be well-meaning. Now I know, I know. Don’t @ me. A lot of these people out here
getting canceled do not mean well. Or even if they do, good intentions might not help much when a stranger asks
if they can touch your hair. I mean, unless that stranger
is Jason Momoa. Just saying. (Laughter) He has my consent. But the point is, we don't just want to ignore
thoughtless missteps or worse. But I do believe even alongside
the painful inequities, we are still mostly just people who are trying to do the right thing. And if we are falling short of that, banishment alone doesn't
actually solve the problem. It just creates
more hurt and angry people. Now, I'm hoping that without pretending this is an even playing field, that we can still empathize
with each other just a little bit more. Maybe you can even become
the cancel counsel to someone you would otherwise have written off. Invite them to share
where they were trying to come from, and then show them any biases
they might have been blind to. I'm not saying it's easy. I know a lot of us are really tired, but I also think we would be amazed
at how connecting to someone on that level could take a hurtful event and turn it into a chance
for healing and real progress. Now, listen, I'm -- I'm not saying any of us
will ever be perfect, but maybe we can try
to give each other and ourselves the grace of assuming good intentions while still doing the work that acknowledges how far we have to go. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #art","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'technology', 'animals', 'nature', 'creativity', 'art', 'beauty', 'trees', 'Ersin Han Ersin']",2023-08-24T07:10:55-07:00,2023-08-24T07:10:55-07:00,Science & Technology,"I was a mosquito once, carried by the breeze
in the Grizedale forest in the north of England. As I drifted between the trees, surrounded by the chatter of the forest, swirling waves of pink
and purple engulfed me. Plumes of carbon dioxide
and oxygen as the forest breathed, mesmerized by the beauty
never before glimpsed by human eyes. And I was in awe. Then I was eaten by a dragonfly. I became a dragonfly and discovered a magical world in which the entire forest unfurled
like a film in slow motion, yet faster than your iPhone
camera could capture it. Through my dragonfly eyes,
I took in my surroundings with pretty much
a full spectrum of light, unlike my human self
had ever been able to perceive. These forays into becoming
something other than human came about as part
of our experiential art piece called “In the Eyes of the Animal,” which I developed with my creative
partners, Barney and Robin, alongside the members of our art
collective, Marshmallow Laser Feast. Our aim was to translate the sensory
perception of different species -- a mosquito, a dragonfly,
a frog and an owl -- so we can more deeply understand
how they see, hear and feel. It was for us a step into umwelt, a concept coined by the pioneering
biologist Jakob Von Uexküll to describe the unique
sensory world of an organism. Human notion of reality
is just one among millions. Each species has its own extraordinary and unknowable experience of reality based on the unique ways their senses
translate the world around them. In essence, your and my umwelt fundamentally differs from the umwelt
of a mosquito or a dragonfly. Marcel Proust once wrote ""The only true voyage of discovery is to behold the universe
through the eyes of another."" Our voyage of discovery
into animal kingdom led us to plant kingdom and eventually to trees where miracles
appear in every level of magnification. All we need to do is to look closely. In 2016, we found ourselves standing
in front of a giant sequoia tree in Sequoia National Park in California. These giant trees are portals through which you leave
your human self-importance behind and embody something
much larger, much stranger, much more than human. All I could think of was, ""What is it like to be a tree?"" What is it like to be one of the largest
organisms that has ever existed? One that has endured
more than 2,500 years? How does it feel to host
a vast web of relationships that anchor an entire ecosystem? Now step with me into this giant as we peer through the bark, the vascular system
of the tree reveals itself. Infinitely complex
patterns and relationships, connect all forms of life
into a tapestry of interdependence. Carbon and water, more than 1,000 liters of water, in fact, flow freely through the phloem
and xylem tubes carry it along. We ascend to the canopy.
Among the neon green moss and the lichen-covered branches, we shrink in size
and sit upon a pine needle. A photon of light hits the surface,
water turns into oxygen and the life we know it
materializes in front of us. This extraordinary journey of water
inspired us to create our multi-sensory, mixed-reality installation
called “Tree Hugger.” With a team of scientists, programmers, engineers,
LiDAR scanners and scent makers, we immerse ourselves
in the inner workings of a sequoia to render visible what was otherwise
invisible to human eyes. Mileece L'Anson, composer and a musician, recorded human and plant
bioelectrical signals to give us a symphony, a soundscape composed
in collaboration with the flora. In fact, that's what
you've been hearing all along. Participants wore a haptic vest
to feel these vibrations as if their own heartbeat, bringing us a step closer,
imagining what it is like to be a tree. When we contemplate the relationship
between our breathing cells and the breathing planet, we encounter this great question. Where does my body end
and where does the world begin? As you ask yourself this question, I'd like you to pay attention
to your breath. Inhale slowly. And exhale. Feel your tree-like lungs filling
and emptying with a rhythmic flow of air. Oxygenated blood reaches your heart. Your heart pumps
like a murmuration of birds, feeding rivers from the center outwards
to touch every cell in your body. Under your skin, you realize
you are much like a forest ecosystem. In modern industrial societies, we tend to limit our being to our body. Shaped by the confines of your skin, your body is you
and that’s where your you ends. Yet, when we trace our outbreath, the boundary between inside and outside, between self and other, blurs. The air we breathe transcends boundaries, sustaining life as it flows
between all beings. We take anywhere from 17,000
to 30,000 breaths a day. A third of those breaths
coming from the forests and the rest coming from the oceans. This puts us in an intimate
relationship with the trees thousands of times a day. You might think you've never met
a giant sequoia before, but in fact, you've been enmeshed
and entangled with one every moment you've been alive. In other words, we are as much trees as trees are us. Our multisensory,
mixed-reality installation called “We Live in an Ocean of Air” started with this realization. By translating the umwelt of trees
for human understanding, it underscores the bond between humans and the wider family of life
through respiration. As participants follow their outbreath
into a tree, they become one. Now notice your outbreath again. Carbon dioxide that leaves your body lands on a leaf. Opens its pores to drink it in. Carbon travels through the phloem
into the branches, down the tree trunk and even
all the way down to the soil. Here, trees are in ancient cooperation
with the kingdom of fungi. These fine threads of mycelium, those intelligent, root-like
fungal networks that nurture and feed an entire ecosystem. By simply tracing our outbreath, we realize the reciprocity
between all major kingdoms of life pulsing with one harmonious rhythm. This exploration of rich and diverse life that exists beneath
the surface of the soil is the next journey we are embarking on. As fungi capture the public imagination
through groundbreaking research, we are very much inspired
by the works of Suzanne Simard, Merlin Sheldrake and many others. “The Wood Wide Web,”
which is the working title, will bring us into the primordial
relationship between trees, plants, animals and fungi, and aim to dismantle the myth
of human separation from the natural world. As an artist collective, we seek to find emotional resonance
in scientific stories, stories that connect us
to the more-than-human world and, coupled with emerging technologies, deepen our understanding of what is it
to be something other than human. Modern science is revealing something Indigenous knowledge
has always held to be true. That what is outside of us is not separate from us. We need this ancient wisdom
more than ever today and it compels us to use
our technology to both honor and enhance our relationship
with the web of beings. The ability to perceive the world
through the eyes and ears of other beings, through the phloem and xylem of trees, even reconnects us,
humans, to the fantastic and richly diverse network of organisms
that make up our shared Earth. It gives us a greater appreciation
of what is it to be non-human, which in turn lets us more fully grasp
what is it to be human, too. And it reminds us with awe that we are all but extensions
of one another, from tree to tree, to you and me. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

Jr.']",2023-10-30T04:00:37-07:00,2023-10-30T04:00:37-07:00,Comedy,you know for a lot of us the world can feel like a really chaotic place there's so many things happening all over the world all at once and with cable news and the internet and social media we have access to all of it and while there are a lot of good things peered in there so much of the information we get can feel big and heavy and weighty which is why for many of us the preferred way to consume information about the world is with a dose of humor well our guest today specializes in just that he is a comedian he's an actor he's a journalist and he's an Emmy nominated producer please welcome Roy Wood Jr thank you Chris how you doing I'm doing great well Roy you know a lot of people know you as a comedian who sometimes plays a journalist on TV but you actually do speaking of your academic background you actually do have a background in journalism both in terms of your lineage your your father was a legendary journalist and your own education can you um to start us off maybe tell us more about that back and how it influences the way you define yourself as a comedian and also as a Storyteller I I grew up you know my father was a civil rights journalist my father if it was black and it was Strife he was embedded there so we're going all the way back to soo riots he got shot at by snipers he was embedded in Vietnam uh with predominantly black platoon he was part of the Civil Rights Movement he was in rhia now Zimbabwe covering that Civil War so you know my father has always been a person that has just always tried to find what's wrong and at least be a bullhorn for what was happening and so I grew up watching the local news every night my dad watch the local news and yell at the my dad would yell at the news the way people yell at football like the I'm not going to sit here and act like this is the family business I mean I have a lot of journalists in my family but I wanted to be a firefighter man I wanted to be a fire fighter and then I saw Stuart Scott and I wanted to do Sports I wanted to be funny I wanted to be Jenny moose I wanted to be Kenny Maine you know that that's those are the people that I looked up to and then once somewhere I got into my 30s I caught myself yelling at the television and I just like ah time to change my comedy well it is true right like so much of Comedy comes from some frustration with the things that are happening in the world often in a really small like insignificant way but it comes from that same H why is it like this you know question that other people don't seem to be paying attention to often yeah and I think that was part of the shift to journalism and and then just what happened is that as I when I started I started standing up when I was 19 so I didn't really have a lot to say all my jokes were about book buyback and your roommate eating your food just but once I turned that corner around my late 20s into my early 30s I started taking a little bit of a more journalistic approach to like what we were taught at Florida A&M was what is the thing you can say about this topic that hasn't been said yet or that you wish could be said and so that became kind of the same North Star for me comedically and I mean honestly to me comedy is journalism it's just you're just reporting on either what's happening to you personally or what's happening to all of us collectively it's not that different you know and I think once you're once you're in a truthful space then you have an opportunity to to truly connect with people and you know like that's just what it's been like I wish I could tell you that this was some deliberate Arc from when I was the first time I saw Sinbad on the HBO free preview weekend in the '90s and like no I just I enjoyed getting up in a room full of strangers and just trying to accepting the challenge of trying to make them laugh and the things that became of Worth to me became very important and then I had a child and then it became very serious about okay well what am I trying to say what the hell am I talking about let's actually try and let's structure something here yeah I I'd love to talk to you about that because you know Father Figure and imperfect messenger two of your comedy specials which are two of my favorite comedy specials of all time they they both open with you talking to your son so how how did having a kid change the way that you think about comedy and change maybe the responsibility of having a platform and people paying attention to you A lot of it if I'm being honest it's just me leaving Breck crumbs of knowledge for him for when he's older in case I'm not here that's really a lot of what it of what it is you know it's me having it's the general public getting to witness me leave messages to my child that's kind of what my career starting to turn into and I'm perfectly fine with that and it's not from a play and I don't say that in some morbid sense of die tomorrow but it is essentially important to me to make sure that the lessons and my father died when I was 16 and I think that's also part of why I'm wired like this now because there are certain lessons and things that I just wasn't we weren't wasn't time for those conversations when I was a teenager so the things that I really hope that he understands about himself in the world let me start putting that stuff out there in the world now comedically a little bit and I just think infusing him just a little bit kind of creates that through line of you know who it is I'm actually talking to without it being you know nail on the head you know there's just certain you know it it's also part of why I'm my standup I don't talk at least I try not to talk about specific people you know in part of that because you know for seven years on The Daily Show that's what we do we talk about people and I want to talk about issues and feelings because the issues will tend to still be there as the people affecting or disaffect those issues come and go it's always a the the the people trying to change the isues are revolving door but the issue Remains the issue so there's a question from one of the audience members Susan and I think this really relates exactly to what you're saying which is how can you use humor as a tool to bring up those difficult issues or questions I think that it's about figuring out a way to find the common denominator between people so so when I started doing standup again as a teenager if you're trying to do comedy every week in the South and I'm from Birmingham I was in school in Tallahassee so those are my two comedy bases but if you're in buxy you're at the casinos performing for retirees if you're in Florida down on the Lower East Coast it's l it's Latino heavy redneck heavy on the Gul Coast side you could be doing an urban night in Atlanta you could be doing a mainstream night in Nashville so what I started what I hated was always having to change up my jokes and change up everything whereas if I could figure out the things that connect us then I'd never have to change no matter where I am like you can find certain topics that and I don't mean that from a divisive versus non- divisive place but I just mean it for the things that we're passionate about if you start in a general place you know it's food it's love it's entertainment and some sort of form of employment or provision making money the thing that emotionally fulfills you right so what I what I what I started doing was trying to do material that was rooted in one of those things we all love a food we all desire emotion or have experienced heartbreak we all desire even if it's not employment if you just want to go hike what's the thing you want so if I share my emotion and my passion for something then in theory these people should be connected with me because they have a similar one so if you find a way to connect people in the beginning of a conversation then they are more open to receiving humor you know like it's it's not you you can't just joke joke joke joke joke you have to come in from some level and degree of understanding you know I think that for as long as people understand your intentions then humor is not the tight rope that we think it to be you know especially when people are starting out in comedy they they try and make these really General jokes that are are often kind of overwritten or overthought and I find that often the things that make people laugh the most are just the most honest the the truest thing you can say the most vulnerable yeah yeah and that's a big that at least for me that has been a big Revelation in in on stage is to realize like you can bring your full self and uh that thing that you're so worried about sharing actually is what other people want to hear and will connect with the most and so now a joke the best jokes land in one of two places it's either the audience absorbs it as wow I didn't know that or I didn't look at it like that or it's that's what I've been trying to say yeah yeah yeah yeah and so if you if you hit either of those nerves then anything you do after that the people they're all uhhuh you get up in front of a boring room and you acknowledge hey yeah I know this is boring let's hurry up and let's let's go let's do it like if you acknowledge the obvious so I spoke at the National Association of black journalists conference in Birmingham earlier this year and it's an average 1M fluorescent light stage Circle T I call it Circle table events the circle table banquet whatever right a challenge yes but which and it's gigs like that that prepared me for the White House cour responded which I want to talk about you do 20 years of circle tables you're ready for the DC Circle table the Super Bowl of circle tables but at that event the first thing I acknowledged was yeah thank you all for coming to Birmingham I know it sucks because there's no Uber black which is a true statement Birmingham my hometown I can say this Uber X is a 20 minute wait and if you're coming from LA or if you're coming from a five minute Uber City then that's a tough thing to to stomach and deal with um so you acknowledge that and then you're able to get into things that are a little tougher and a little harder uh to digest and often things that a lot of people don't want to laugh at or do not find funny yeah lordis in Mexico is saying that uh comedy is is underrated around the world but it's truly a tool for mental health and I I really agree in the sense too that like something that I've always admired about your comedy from the first time that I saw you is that you are able to talk about really heavy serious stuff in a way that's hilarious but you're also not afraid to talk about the light you know just goofy absurd stuff too you you have a mix of both and and that's such a joy to watch on stage comedians because we are of this craft we are a little more I don't know if encrusted is the word I don't know it's not salmon but we're hardened calcified there you go we're galvanized emotionally so things don't hit us as hard right away it's just funny to me and it's just it's weird and it's observ like I I've been talking about on stage to mixed reviews that I know white people are going through stuff because they're showing up you know in full fatigue to protest at Disney world like it's 90 degrees bro there's better attire you want to protest Pro like say what you want about the clan but at least the robe was nice and breathable and so that's it feels Pro Clan but it's not it's Pro so it's it's it's stuff like that where you make that joke now we can get into the deeper topic of white supremacy and now we can get into something a little more weird because we've made the kind of weird obvious joke that you would have never thought about but like oh yeah the clan yeah they never did they they wore loose stuff because they didn't want to die of heat stroke so it's fun to me it's fun to find those lines and those edges there's a question from Gretchen that I think is is a really important one which is when we're talking about creating those under that understanding of your intentions how do you create that understanding with the audience when you're making a joke that is on on the line or that could be kind of interpreted in different ways because it does seem like many times there's a risk of people kind of filling in the blanks and and thinking uh you know as Gretchen put it that there could be a simplistic assumption about you as a person based on your gender age residence political affiliation so how do you how do you get to the real understanding of what your actual intention is with the audience uh I think that comes just in time with within the duration of the performance so you know one thing for me that I have to work on and a lot of this this goes back to psychology I used to watch this show on N Geo called brain games and the they they brought it back in a couple different iterations now it's more of a game showy thing now with Keegan with um Keegan Michael ke but in the earliest iterations of the show it just showed you how the human mind works and so I enjoyed the show because it talked about how something as simple as a smile before you say something versus a smile after you say something and how those change two different it literally changes the intention of it if you smile first then say it it seems Sinister but if you say it to feel Sinister then smile at the back end it's like ah come on I'm me like like it there's a way to kind of yo-yo a little bit you know and then sometimes you know be bold and just say what it is you're thinking and it might be a smile on the back end it might be something a little more like like there was we were talking about Mike Pence and you know this was a old this is this was um this is during when when Daily Show um we were still on and it was a joke we were thinking about doing for my guest hosting week wherein essentially the argument I was trying to make was that of all of the current presidential candidates Mike Pence is the most confident because he has to get people who tried to kill him to vote for him and so that could work on stage but in the context of television in the context of structure there are people who would legitimately believe that what I'm saying is serious and there are people who would pull that little bite and put that up on whatever website and go roywood Jr endorses Mike Pence and then on the liberal side there's people who will see that link or see that headline not click it and then assume the worst of me so a lot of it also comes down to understanding the medium through which you're communicating the thing you know I also think that some of this feels like because you are are very much not in in overnight success right it wasn't like one day you were at an open mic and the next day you were on The Daily Show instead you had worked your way up through clubs you had been on radio you had been on uh television shows and then you had this big huge platform you I feel like one thing that is really true and I'm curious if it feels like this for you but you have to me felt like someone who has a really clear sense of himself and his voice and what he's willing to say or not say and I think that really comes across to an audience as well does it feel like that to you internally it does now but it didn't for like 15 years like you can go back and watch it's still up online you can go back and watch my old conen O'Brien sets from 2011 through 24 there was a stretch in my career where Conan O'Brien was the only person who would put me on TV every other show said no any other show that I'd already done would not have me back for whatever reason I'm not talking trash but facts Conan O'Brien was the only person who would book me and put me on television and you can see the evolution over those three or four those four or five years of Conan sets and that was kind of where I started turning the corner on talking about race relations in this country and that being a little bit more of an integral part of what I wanted to talk about on stage that's where I probably really started you know to turn that corner a little bit and now it's definitely pronounced it's clear I know what I want to do the next hour special I want it's about all of the men other than my father who influenced me after his death this idea of manhood and fatherhood and masculinity and then realizing I have a plethora of stories some funny some moving some you know I'm a comedian I have been very close to Comics that have killed themselves many of them I know I knew so this idea of all of these different life lessons where did I get those from well I want to actually talk about some of my favorite jokes that sound like they're kind of more in the past from from you but you know I always think that one of the the highest compliments that I can give to a a comedian is that they have a joke that I think about for the rest of my life you've changed the way that I will think about seeing an object or being in a situation and you have a a bunch of these you have some of the my most secondhand described jokes where we're in a situation and I say oh you have to watch this Roy Wood Jr joke about this and one of them is I forever now anytime I see an oversized American flag I always think about your incredible joke about the the the math of American flags how many American flags equal a Confederate flag there's too many flags in one place I don't feel comfortable it's so funny and I just constantly think about you describing it as like that there's the residue of racism that too many American flags you can feel that it has it has a different message it's not blatantly racist but I'm watching you this ISS a lot it's too many effing Flags yeah but I mean like a joke like that that just comes from driving in the South for half a million miles absolutely I've driven every freeway in State Road I've seen the big Garrison Flags when you come into town and there's something really good and prideful about it and then I've also been in you know some corner store where there's a bunch of don't tread on me and all like it's it's interesting it's it's very interesting and and to me that's not even and that's a joke where in a way if you love the flag and you're not racist how can I thread this so you'll laugh at it too because this isn't about your love of the flag this is how when there's too many flags on the same street how it makes me feel and I'm not saying it is racist I'm just saying this like even the thing we I talked about in the figure yeah about how I like the Confederate flag it's I would rather know where you stand in your racism than for you to be covert with it yep that's and it's just a broader statement about Society I would much rather it's it's like that it's like the the the discussion just about you know down south racism versus upnorth racism and how it's very polite and up you know North Northerners are very prejudiced but it's not in your face where in the South it's just straight up no stay over there don't even this is a Sundown town and I want you to know that like there's no Northern Sundown towns well it's such I think it's such a that that joke from Father Figure is such a perfect way of getting at something that is really nuanced about this conversation around history and symbols right of like that that you're you're Pro Confederate flag not because of the memory of the Confederacy because it lets you know who feels that way and some formation you know something that you worked on that is one of I absolutely love this documentary you were an executive producer on uh a documentary called the neutral ground and and that is made by this incredible filmmaker CJ hunt and it's about the fight to remove Confederate monuments and it looks at a really serious very sobering issue but in a hilarious way so I'm curious since that is so much of you know you have this family history of being involved in the Civil Rights struggle and now you yourself you have this big platform and you are using it to talk about some of these same issues so I'd love to to kind of get into that idea of how humor can be a way to confront history and why it might actually be a powerful way to do that I think it's I think we're past yelling at each other to get anybody to understand where you're coming from I just if the last eight years of politics have proven nothing more it has proven that two people screaming at each other is not going to get anything done you know we live in our own information Bubbles as well but you know I think one of the things that made George Carlin so amazing was that he could get you to laugh at something even if you didn't agree with him and I think that's always been the same approach so CJ hunt who who you know directed and made this film you know CJ and I met at The Daily Show you know he was a field director and before that he was working over at Robin theti so he was already in that grou groove of looking at humor from The Rundown with Robin the which was also like a political satire vehicle over at bet and so this idea of if I can get you to laugh at it then I can get you to listen and so you want to find jokes even if they're on yourself or at the if even if the jokes are at the expense of yourself and I think the thing that was very what I respected about CJ's approach to the neutral ground was that it didn't come necessarily from a place of attacking the people who believed and defended The Monuments it was simply an exploration into why what is it that makes you feel this now what if I told you this this and this about history and that everything that you've been everything you've been sold since reconstruction was propaganda and a lie the mothers of the Confederacy spun half of this stuff and got these monuments like this wasn't even supposed to be like so exploring it from that place instead of chastising people who want to defend all of that you know and there were still parts of that documentary that got very real for CJ you know he went to Charlottesville and I don't think anyone predicted that Charlottesville would have become you know such a lightning rod point because there have been so many Charlottesville before just so many other we're going to show up in protest and yell at each other from across the street incidents and Charlottesville was one that when off the rails and even in that you sit in the real feelings and the horror of that and you're still able to use humor to come out on the other side and you know I think that you know for the people that are looking at this especially like in the professional sector where you're trying to use humor and you're trying to use something light-hearted to go into issues that are serious within your companies or within your personal life you don't have to joke on the issue the issue itself is not funny but how did we get here that's funny the causation who are the people responsible for the causation or who are the people that are fighting to change this there's humor in that who are the people fighting against change who are the people fighting for change and I think if you if you look in those areas around an issue you're always going to find fertile ground so you're always going to find something on the outer rings that is worthy of satire or observation and even if it has to wait a day you wait a day but you know there's always going to be you know when you look back you know I look back you know you know and Trevor Noah had the unfortunate task of Hosting The Daily Show pretty much every time an unarmed cop killing footage got released it was a show week and so you know this idea of figuring out where the humor is in that and the humor is not in the tragedy it's in the bureaucracy around it so I just think when you look at it that way then you're able to find Pockets where you can you know you can you can jab a joke real quick and get in and get out it doesn't have to be hilarious all the way through but you definitely want as best you can to try and use humor I just think it's I just think it's a better way you know of doing things so for people who are listening who you know they they see the power of humor they see the power of Comedy but they're not professional comedians that they don't necessarily think of themselves that way what tips would you give them for trying to successfully land a joke without offending people I think if it's about trying to find humor without offending I I don't think that that place truly exists I think that you can try to make it as offense proof as possible so the first thing you have to do is let go of the fact that someone is is or isn't going to be offended um or you delve in the four as I call it the four the four safety Corners like food is never offending it not to the point of War maybe on Twitter if I if I go on Twitter and go I hate this food then a bunch of people but you can still show up to work the next day you're not going to get sent to HR because you said you didn't like macaroni with breadcrumbs which by the way is not the way to do macaroni please stop putting breadcrumbs in macaroni and stop truffling everything I'm getting off top oh people are oh the the comments are going off right now people are Furious about I see the Emojis floating up stop truffling everything I said it it's there's no reason everything doesn't have to taste like a fart only pasta so if you're not attacking a person or an ideology or a group of people you're generally in a safe place um if you are not attacking a particular reason why something happened um also don't make jokes based on assumptions of the truth of why you think someone did something because what we also live in is a correction culture and so people are quick to go well you know the reason why that actually happened so if you go he did that because this and joke well someone who doesn't believe that premise you know mik bigle has said it best everybody has to agree on the premise before we'll agree on to laugh at the punchline and I think that's what we've we've lost as of late but if we're just talking short fire short answer rapid fire food entertainment love and money like job employment if you stay in those four pockets it's going to be hard to offend someone but if you're if you're determined to make the EDG of your joke just know that somebody might not like it especially if it's at the expense of another group well a lot of people in the in the um audience here are asking some version of this question this is one of the most common things that people want to know about comedy these days I find it's like but what aren't you afraid of being canceled aren't you afraid of what what will happen if people take it the wrong way so how do you how do you think about that I don't think about jokes being taken the wrong way I can't concern myself with that my job is to write the joke that I think is funny and perform it for the people people who want to laugh now I exist in a different space because I'm not at a company where I can be written up I can't go I can't be sent to HR at a comedy club all that happens is that people either show up or they don't show up and at the end of the day I think that people vote with their wallets and their remote controls and so if there's people that still love you they're going to come see you and so those are the people that you do it for and you ultimately cannot if you're constantly performing to not piss off a group of people then who are you because now you're constantly altering yourself to public ideologies and to me that's a very dangerous and uncreative place to be because now you're trying to be creatively aloc cart for whatever the moods are at that particular time and if you're that then at what point are you ever yourself the the thing though that I wonder about is how do you balance the authenticity and the courage to say something that you believe in regardless of consequences with the ability to stay open to valid critiques about places where you're getting it wrong or you haven't thought it through all the way because it seems like a lot of times people take any criticism as an attack and shutting it down rather than an opportunity to grow so how do you balance those Nuance has been removed from the from the conversation you know I've always welcomed you know critique and criticism but then critique and criticism also has to come from a place of not trying to completely chop somebody's head off and I think I I'm one of the few comedians that reads their YouTube comments I know you shouldn't but YouTube and Reddit are by far the most comprehensive and fair critiques of any forms of entertainment in my opinion better than Facebook better than Twitter all of that because like Twitter and Facebook like that's all engagement and arguing in the comments like it's performative I consider that outrage performative whereas if you're typing a Reddit thread you don't know who's gonna see this it might only four people might see this or or a million like that's from the heart um I just I just don't think that you can I don't think that you can truly say you evolving as a performer if you're not looking at how some of the material is making people feel whether you adjust to it or not is up to you but what I do not like is the retroactive cancellation of oh here's something that you said from 15 years ago at a time where Society was different and I will judge it now based on current societal standards and attack you as if you just said it yesterday that I'm not cool with I I think that's a little bit of a if we want to acknowledge the past and apologize and get past it cool but totally and also you know any good performer any person that you want to spend time with hopefully they've grown and changed and improve you know and I think that's part of that should be part of that assessment when you find the old clip on person let's also take a look at their Arc from that time until now uh but I do think that jokes have real effects like I I think it's it's naive to think that you can make a joke and speak truth to power and and and establishment and the the government will change with this joke and then also not think that you can write a joke that could destroy somebody and make them feel inhumane you know we've been talking about how it's important to have a thick skin to be a comic and yet many artists and many creative people are really sensitive and that's that's key to tapping into their creativity so what advice do you have for people who are artists or creative people who want to be more comfortable getting that feedback who want to get to the place where maybe they could read their RIT comments or their YouTube comments but but they feel like they they aren't there yet find a person you love and read their YouTube comments and see the hate and see and just you're literally you're going to be amazed at how could someone not like that project or that movie what's a movie you love go read some reviews it's all got haters and once you see that it'll help normalize it a little bit for you and you'll know that what you were doing is not that different and that's just all part of the path you know I know some people don't like hate and it's also very different for women which is something that I learned from talking with a lot of you know with a lot of uh women comics in the industry that is you know what I've benefited from is that most any insult that I filled it has been a critique of my art it wasn't a death threat it wasn't my looks it was you know things of that nature so you know by all means I wouldn't say immerse yourself into anything that's triggering or your own traumas but if you can as best you can look and assess the things that you love and just see that none of it is unfailable it all gets insulted it all gets critiqued by people who can't do it who don't know what they're doing and once you understand that that's part of the process then you're able to trust what you're doing and just find your audience find the people who like you that's all you got to do well let's let's go and talk about the the White House correspondence dinner for a second because you hosted it this year and you know this is you're directly talking to the most powerful people in the country and I'm curious what jokes you were proudest of that you got to say in that setting I had like you know six or seven writers working with me on this um former Daily Show former nightly show you know all all worth their weight in the political satire sphere and we were constantly changing everything like we man I had a whole five minute spy balloon chunk and by the time we got to the dinner no one cared about spy balloons anymore like it was just such a we made so we made it a throwaway joke and it worked but the Clarence Thomas nft joke still makes me laugh and saying that we can see him but he's owned by someone else and that's what an nft is um which you know considering that people call Clarence Thomas a token black guy and nft also means token and they thought that I was also that was like a happy accident where people were like oh yeah you called him a token like nft a token I was like yes yes I did absolutely that was the intention when mhm you caught that well Roy it's been such a pleasure talking to you thank you so much and and congratulations on all of your degrees it's really impressive well yes thank you I worked very hard at them with [Music] sharpies

#TED #TEDTalks #Ukraine","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'Global Issues', 'Politics', 'Corruption', 'Military', 'war', 'humanity', 'Ukraine', 'Law', 'Human Rights', 'Ethics']",2023-10-24T07:27:00-07:00,2023-10-24T07:27:00-07:00,Nonprofits & Activism,"I have traveled here from Kyiv, where I am a human rights lawyer. I have been applying the law to defend
people and human dignity for many years. At present, I am in a situation
when the law doesn't work. Russia’s troops are destroying
residential buildings, schools, churches, hospitals and museums. They’re shooting
at the evacuation corridors. They're torturing people
in filtration camps. They are forcibly taking
Ukrainian children to Russia. They ban Ukrainian language and culture. They are abducting, raping, robbing and killing
in the occupied territories. And the entire UN architecture
of international organizations and treaties can't stop it. As a human rights lawyer, I found myself in a weird position. When someone asks me how to protect
people from Russian aggression, I answer, ""Give Ukraine weapons."" I have one question. How we people, in the 21st century, will defend human beings, their lives, their freedom
and their dignity? Can we rely on the law? Or does only brutal force matter? It's important to understand this,
not just for people in Ukraine, Iran, China or Sudan. The answer to this question
determines our common future. Because this is not just
a war between two states. This is a war between two systems: authoritarianism and democracy. Russia wants to convince
to the entire world that democracy, rule of law and human rights
are fake values. Because they couldn’t protect
anyone in the war. Russia wants to convince that a state
with a powerful military potential, a nuclear weapon, can break international order, can dictate its rule to the entire
international community, and even forcibly change
internationally recognized borders. And if Russia succeeds, it will encourage other authoritarian
leaders in the world to do the same. The international system of peace
and security doesn't work anymore. And so democratic governments
will be forced to invest their money not in education, healthcare,
culture or business development, not in solving global problems like climate change or social inequality, but in weapons. We will witness an increase
of the number of nuclear states, the emergence of the robotic armies
and new weapons of mass destruction. If Russia succeeds
and this scenario comes true, we will find ourselves in a world which will be dangerous for everyone,
without any exception. Unpunished evil grows. Russian military committed terrible crimes in Chechnya, Moldova, Georgia,
Mali, Syria, Libya, other countries of the world. They have never been punished. They believe they can do
whatever they want. I've talked to hundreds of people
who survived Russian captivity. They told me how they were beaten, raped, packed into wooden boxes, electrically shocked
through their genitalia, and their fingers were cut, their nails were turned away, their knees were drilled, they were compelled to write
with their own blood. One woman told me how her eye
was dug out with a spoon. There is no legitimate purpose
for doing this. There is also no military necessity in it. Russians did these horrible things
only because they could. Because for now, the law doesn't work. Although, I trust that it’s temporary. The war turned people into numbers. Because the scale
of war crimes grows so large, that it becomes impossible
to recognize all the stories. But I will tell you one. This is a story of 62-year-old
civilian Oleksandr Shelipov. He was killed by the Russian military
near his own house. This tragedy received
a huge media coverage only because it was the first
court trial after the February 24. In the court, his wife Kateryna shared that her husband was an ordinary farmer. But he was her whole universe. And now she lost everything. People are not numbers. We must ensure justice for all, regardless who the victims are,
their social position, the type and level of cruelty
they endured, and if international organizations
or media are interested in their case. It's possible. New technologies allow us
to document war crimes in a way we couldn't even
dream of 15 years ago. The experience of Bellingcat and other investigators
convincingly proved that we can restore what was happening, even without being on the spot. People are not numbers. We must return people their names. Because the life of each person matters. But we still look at the world through
the lens of the Nuremberg trials, when Nazi war criminals were tried
only after the Nazi regime had collapsed. But we are living in a new century. Justice shouldn't be dependent
on how and when this war will end. We cannot wait. The global approach to war crime justice
needs to be changed. We must establish a special tribunal now and hold Putin, Lukashenko
and other war criminals accountable. (Applause) Yes, this is a courageous step. But we must do it because this is the right thing to do. I have been working
with the law for many years, and I know for sure when you can't rely on legal mechanisms, you can still rely,
and always rely on people. We are used to thinking in categories
of states and interstate organizations, but ordinary people have much more impact
than they can even imagine. Immediately after the invasion, international organizations
evacuated their personnel. So it was ordinary people
who supported those in the combat zone. Who took people out
from the ruined cities. Who helped to survive
under artillery fire. Who rescued people trapped
under the rubble of residential buildings. Who broke through the encirclement
to provide humanitarian aid. Ordinary people started to do
extraordinary things. And then it became obvious that ordinary people
fighting for their freedom are stronger than even
the second army in the world. (Applause) That the ordinary people, at mass mobilization of ordinary people
in different countries, can change the world history
quicker than the UN intervention. People in Ukraine survived
also because of you. When ordinary people in different
countries started to support us. Someone is collecting donations. Someone is writing
about what is happening. Someone is holding rallies, demanding their governments
to supply Ukraine with weapons. Someone closed its own business
in Russia because freedom is worth it. Be that someone. (Applause) Support our struggle. Make our voice tangible. Take an active position, not just oppose. There are so many things
which have no limitation in state borders. Freedom is one of such things as well as human solidarity. When full-scale invasion started, the democratic countries said,
""Let's help Ukraine not to fail."" But we must instead think
about helping Ukraine to win. There is a huge difference between
""Let's help Ukraine not to fail"" and ""Let's help Ukraine to win fast."" (Applause) Democracies have to win wars because only the spread of freedom
makes our world safer. And this is not about Ukraine 
laying down its arms. People in Ukraine want peace
more than anyone else. But peace doesn't come when the country 
which was invaded stops fighting. That's not peace. That's occupation. (Applause) And occupation, just another form of war. Occupation is not about changing
one state flag to another. Occupation means torture, sexual violence,
enforced disappearances, denial of your identity, forcible adoption of your own children, filtration camps and mass graves. I would never wish anyone
to go through this experience. But these dramatic times provide us an opportunity
to reveal the best in us. To be courageous, to fight for freedom, to take a burden of responsibility. To make difficult but right choices. And to help each other. Now, like never before, we are acutely aware
of what does it mean to be a human. And we have no time. Time for us [is converted into] death. After all, you don't need to be Ukrainian
to support freedom and Ukraine. You just need to be a human. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #AI","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'culture', 'technology', 'computers', 'creativity', 'art', 'AI', 'K Allado-McDowell']",2023-09-11T08:52:25-07:00,2023-09-11T08:52:25-07:00,Science & Technology,"I think it's safe to say there's never been a moment like this one in all of history. Of course, it's always safe to say that because every moment is unique
and can never be reproduced. But when it comes to AI, the changes we've seen
in a single generation, and lately in a single day, are truly historically novel. We are the first human beings
to ever experience this. I want to talk about how we experience it. AI is changing how we work and create. It's helping us solve
complex problems in ecology, urban planning and medicine. From diagnosing disease
to detecting forest fires, AI is giving us a new view
of our planet and ourselves. This comes with challenges. There are ongoing debates
and open questions about ethics, power and the relationships
between humans and machines. Are we at risk of losing
what makes us most human? How can we preserve and even enhance
the best in ourselves with AI? I think the answer to these questions
lies in three principles. Creation, collaboration and care. Creation, collaboration and care. We need to nurture
creative relationships with AI. I've written with AI on several projects and as an author I've seen firsthand how AI co-writing can open the mind
with remarkable results. To test these ideas,
I wrote a novel with GPT-3. The AI suggested
synchronistic plot twists, penetrating character arcs and critical perspectives
I wouldn't have thought of on my own. Together, we created something
more compelling and imaginative than either of us would have alone. So let's co-create with AI. I love collaborations because collaborations are more
than the sum of their parts. For almost 10 years, I have been bringing artists
and philosophers in to work with researchers at Google AI through the Artists and Machine
Intelligence Program. By collaborating with machines,
we've encouraged a new form of art that combines and transforms
photography, poetry, cinema and music
with machine-learning models. But we've also brought the critical
and creative imaginations of artists into the process of developing AI. If we want a world
that preserves and enhances the best parts of being human, we need a wide range
of voices and disciplines present in the process of making AI. So let's collaborate on making AI. AI needs a goal. It needs a North Star. I believe the highest purpose
for AI is to be healing. That's why I created the opera
""Song of the Ambassadors,"" working with neuroscientists
to study the effects of music and human-AI feedback loops. By integrating AI-generated
brainwave imagery into the performance, we were able to propose
new musical and therapeutic approaches. ""Song of the Ambassadors"" is offered
as a prototype for a new kind of art that turns our highest technology
towards collective healing. So let's care for each other with AI. These principles are simple. They might seem obvious, but the world is changing fast
and AI is complex. So the point needs to be made clearly. AI should preserve and enhance
the best parts of being human. But first, we must imagine new
possibilities and new narratives for our future together. The next time you're thinking about or even thinking with AI, look for opportunities to create, collaborate and care. Thank you. (Applause) [A new era for opera beckons] [Co-created by humans
and artificial intelligence] [We proudly present a hymn
to nature and existence] [This is also a neuroscience study] [It's called] [""Song of the Ambassadors""] (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #fashion","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'sustainability', 'business', 'social change', 'humanity', 'Amy Powney']",2023-10-09T04:00:47-07:00,2023-10-09T04:00:47-07:00,People & Blogs,"I was determined to be a designer.
A fashion designer. My career was built
off my childhood happy place of crafting with my mother, and I dreamt of unleashing my creativity in an industry that was borne
on style and trends and luxury. It was a contradiction to my own childhood
of hand-me-downs and no logos, often teased by my peers. I grew up in the north
of England, off grid. My parents worked as local food farmers, and I had a real innate understanding
of where things came from. We were the bottom of the food chain. We all worked as farmers, and I watched our small wind turbine turn natural resources
into energy firsthand. It did also mean if it wasn't windy,
I couldn't watch TV. Getting into my dream industry. I'm a very inquisitive person,
so I decided to pick away at the seams. And so six years ago, as the 
creative director of Mother of Pearl, I embarked on a mission to make a fully sustainable
collection for my brand. I didn't really know what that meant, so I journeyed from field
to finished product, emotionally engaging
with the people and the planet, picking away the chains,
linking them back together. We all get the notion
of farm to table, right? We understand where
our fresh produce comes from. It's written on the packet and also from point of harvest
to the final product, it kind of looks the same. But what about field to fashion? Fashion is also born of natural resources. Your clothes come
from either an worm, an animal, agriculture, forestry or fossil fuels. Without worms, there is no silk,
no sheep, there's no wool. Without agriculture, there’s no cotton,
no trees, no viscose. And polyester, which is the most
widely used fabric of all, because it’s cheap, comes from fossil fuels,
is made of crude oil, which is the same oil
that you put into your car, the same fuel you put into your car. When we talk about climate change,
we talk about the big stuff. We talk about aviation, travel,
shipping, logistics, agriculture, industrialization, plastic pollution, fossil fuels. But this is where your clothes come from,
and they are playing their part. Take a polyester dress, for instance. It is both fossil fuel and plastic pollution combined. When it's made, it contributes to climate change
in its industrial processing. When it's washed, it releases
microplastics into the ocean, into the food chain, into us. When you throw it away,
it ends up in landfill, and in landfill, it takes
hundreds of years to degrade. It's no different
than your plastic packaging, but it does give trashy dressing
a whole new meaning. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) OK, so how did we get here? We buy three times as many clothes
as we did in 1980 and wear them for half as long. Your grandmother
would have mended her clothes, but now three out of five
end up in landfill within the first year of purchase. It changed within one generation, and it's set to increase
by 62 percent by 2030. This is one of the biggest landfills. This is in Chile, and it can now
be seen from space. It's mostly also made up
of unused and unsold clothing. So mass industrialization and a linear production model
of global capitalism gave birth to the notion that we could
and should have it all faster and cheaper, which means we've lost
connection to our clothes. We do not know or seem to care
where they come from. And when I say we,
I mean all of us that wear clothes, but also the brands that make them. When you look in your label
of your clothing, it will tell you
where it was manufactured, but it doesn't tell you how it was spun,
woven, dyed, finished. Also, it doesn't tell you
about the 3.4 billion people that work in the industry, 70 percent of which are female, often invisible, and for the most part
not paid a living wage. In fashion, we love to talk
about equality, feminism, diversity, empowerment. We celebrate the celebrities
and the influencers that wear our designs, and yet we don't talk
about the women that make them. We treat them just like
that polyester dress, disposable and cheap. And in that search
for that cheap supply chain and cheap materials, your garments here, one of your garments today,
that you're wearing, could have traveled
through five different countries, and up to 20 different
processes along the way. Chances are your outfit
is better traveled than you are, and your wardrobes most definitely are. So, we have to choose ethics, too. But how do we do this? Fashion is borne on buying more,
shopping more, consuming more. When I was at design school, they just taught me
to design something beautiful, and how it was made
was almost an afterthought. But now, with everything
that I've learned, I flipped that entire process on its head. So I start with sustainable,
traceable supply chains, and I design from there up. Some designers would suggest
that was hindering creativity, but to quote the economist Kate Raworth, ""Boundaries unleash potential."" Look at what Mozart did
with a five-octave piano. And I would agree. So with everything I learned,
this is what I did for our brand. I set my non-negotiables. This is the best possible practices
of the supply chain. For instance, we use natural organic
farming practices for our natural fibers and replacement of synthetics
or virgin synthetics like polyester. There's many more,
but they are just some of the solutions. This was also designed for two reasons. It was designed as a kind
of benchmark for my team. So we had kind of goals to work to, but it was also
to help educate the consumer. Most online stores, when you shop, you can filter them by size, color, fit. But for us, we also let you filter it
by attribute or material, trying to put ethics and aesthetics
in the same conversation. But only once I’d implemented this --
and it took a long time to do it, and we were very proud -- but what I also realized is that we just made
a better version of an existing system which was broken. It's the best of, but it's still take, make, use and lose. And so now I realized we have to add
another link to that supply chain and join it all together
and create a circular system. And by that I mean so many things. But for an example, if we're going to cut a tree down
and we replace it, could the replacement
add more value back to the forest? What about if regenerative
and organic farming practices could become the new normal, and each picker’s lives nourished
along with the soil itself? And then new links could be added
for every aspect of the business. What if we looked
at profit and loss, for instance? What if we turn that into pay it forward? What if we reimagine
the concept of success? They say we eat
a credit card's worth of plastic every week with the microplastics. And when all is said and done, we won't be able to eat money. For me, the answer is very simple. The very notion
of questioning everything is key, and being responsible for my actions
as a business leader and an individual is key. And for those that are willing
to not think and rethink, we have to pass legislation. On this journey, I didn't think it was very revolutionary trying to meet my sheep
that made my clothes, but it turns out it was. Before I knew it, I was on the news, the subject of a documentary, writing columns for British ""Vogue."" And that gives me a lot of hope. But fashion is still everything you think. It's trends, fast pace, logos, brands. But to fashion something
is to make something. And that was where my passion came from. And what I've learned in this journey
is if I'm going to continue to design and fashion clothing, I must also fashion our future. The two things come hand in hand. Yes, there are technical solutions
to this problem, to these problems, and I can talk endlessly about them, from biomimicry-based dyes and finishes to regenerative and recycled textiles. And it's important.
Technology is important. But the other thing
I've learned in this journey is that it's only when we reconnect
back to the living world and look at it in awe and wonder
and the respect that it deserves will true systemic change happen. And when I talk about the living world,
I talk about the people and the planet. Box-ticking is greenwashing,
and greenwashing is dangerous. It's just the medicine to a symptom
and not the solution to a problem. And fashion absolutely
should not cost the Earth. Nature designs or fashions
the most incredible designs there are. We just simply forgot to look. So my ask: next time you open your wardrobes, instead of seeing clothes, brands, logos
and perhaps your favorite dress, delve a little bit deeper. Go to Narnia. And instead see
the vast and unique ecosystem that makes each piece individual and its inherent connection to our planet on which all of our lives depend. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #battery","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'science', 'sustainability', 'technology', 'innovation', 'energy', 'Countdown', 'renewable energy']",2023-11-03T08:40:59-07:00,2023-11-03T08:40:59-07:00,Science & Technology,"So the world is going electric. And batteries will do for electrification
what the refrigerator did for food, because batteries will allow us
to move clean energy through time and through space. And we don't have a problem
with the availability of energy on this planet. We have a problem with getting this energy
to where we need it, and when we need it. But if we approach battery
manufacturing the wrong way, we will end up repeating
mistakes from the past, mistakes that are at the heart
of the climate environmental crisis that we see today. And that's what I'm here to explain. It's all about the way
we are using the Earth's resources. So historically, and today, we have been mining oil
from the Earth's crust with little concern
for the long-term effect. And this example of how we’ve been
approaching the fossil fuel industry and how we've been dependent on it, how we have been extracting oil
where it's economically possible, refined it, burned it,
and it ends up in the atmosphere -- that's the perfect illustration of the fundamental,
simple and linear model that we are working with: extract, use and discard. When I was a professor
in environmental engineering, I used to teach my students
that mistakes are OK, as long as you learn from your mistakes, and as long as you take action. So now, when we are evolving, when we are changing, when we are building things from scratch, we should think twice,
and we should do it right this time. And what does this mean for batteries? There are two things
we need to know about batteries. One is they require enormous amounts
of energy to produce, and the second is that they are
made from minerals, minerals that require global mining,
refining and processing, and long and complex supply chains. So if we start with energy, a battery factory is a very large
and complex operation. It requires large amounts of heat
and electricity to produce. It starts with a chemical plant; then follow long coating machines. After that, we have cell assembly, which is fine electronics equipment
that require clean and dry rooms. Now at the end of this process, each and every battery cell needs to be charged and discharged
in certain patterns to gain its properties. And if we put this kind of factory
under a fossil fuel grid, we will end up with a carbon footprint, which is the benchmark today, which is around 100 kilograms
of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of produced battery. And how much is that? If we take it at scale, 20, 30 years ... of battery manufacturing will give the total footprint
of about half the size of Germany's. Now that would be a big mistake. Luckily, you can slash that footprint
by some 67 percent -- that's two-thirds -- if you put the same operation
on the renewable energy grid, which we do, in northern Sweden. That, on the other hand,
leaves us with the remaining footprint, the last third, coming entirely from everything
that is outside the factory, and the lion's part from the supply chain. And that leads us to the second topic
we have to talk about, which is the minerals. So batteries are made from minerals -- for example, nickel, cobalt and lithium -- and the way we approach this
is going to determine how much we can further slash
that carbon footprint. Luckily, if we put it
under this renewable grid, if we approach it the right way, with sustainable mining
and a lot of recycling, we can significantly reduce the footprint. One tonne of battery-grade lithium requires 750 tonnes of brine or 250 tonnes of lithium ore. Same with cobalt -- if you need one tonne
of battery-grade cobalt, you have to mine 300 tonnes of cobalt ore. So does this give us a similar situation
to the oil history we have? No, because the difference
is that when we mine metals, they are elements. And if you can get elements back
to their elemental form, they are just as good as new. And this is the fundamental difference between the combustion-engine history
that we're living now and the new electric vehicle industry. Because at the end of the life cycle, you can bring the metals
back from the market, and you can use them again and again. So what we have developed at Northvolt
is a recycling process, where we take the batteries
back from the market, we discharge them fully, we take away the aluminum casing, we take away all the cabling, and then, we take out
the cells and the modules. We take those cells and modules, together with some waste material
we have from the production, and we throw it into a big shredder. We chop it up. We take out the copper foil,
aluminum foil, some plastics. And then, we are left with something
that we call the black mass. And this black mass
is a fine black powder. This fine black powder consists of everything that we had coated
on the electrodes in the factory. It's the graphite from the anode, and it's the nickel, cobalt,
manganese and lithium from the cathode. We take this fine powder, the black mass, we pass it on into
the hydrometallurgical process ... Hydrometallurgy
means treating metal in liquid. And what we do is that we use different pressure changes,
temperature changes and pH to separate them from one another. We refine them, so we get them
into the form that we need for the production -- salts for nickel, cobalt and manganese, or hydroxides for lithium. And then, we do like this. We send them across site,
straight into production. So what we have
is a circular battery economy. And this is the fundamental difference
between the combustion-engine industry and what we are building now. We should do this not only for batteries. We should do it for wind turbines,
we should do it for solar panels, we should do it for all the new industries
that we need for this transformation. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause continues) And we're going to have to accept mining
as part of this transition, absolutely. But when we are taking things
from the Earth's crust, when we are borrowing
from the future generations, we have to do it responsibly, and we have to make sure
that we can use these materials over and over, and over again, because fundamentally, we can. And we should not only build
recycling processes and a port for the materials
when they come to their end of life -- we should also build
accounting and traceability systems so that each carmaker
can follow up and trace how much they can further slash
their footprint by sending the batteries back
at the end of their life. And why we are doing this -- I'm sure you've already
figured this out -- it's not only environmentally beneficial, it's also, of course,
economically profitable, because by doing this, the material sustains its value
through the lifetime. And this altogether
may sound a little bit hard, it may sound a little bit complex, but if we get this right, it will be rewarding on so many levels. And I can tell you
that the young generation of talented engineers
that we hire today, they understand all this, and they ask nothing less from us. So with that said, I just want to say
to all of you who listened, and I also want to say to all the people who packed their bags
and moved up to the Nordics, who are fighting every day
to make this happen, thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

to halt the climate crisis. Going forward, if we're going to reduce the risk
of overshoot of global temperature beyond two degrees C, we also have to reduce the amount
of CO2 that remains in the atmosphere. The team I lead, the US Department
of Energy's Office of Science, is part of an unprecedented
national effort to get us to net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve our goals, we're aiming to establish
a transformative ecosystem of innovation that achieves major innovations
in science and technology for carbon dioxide removal. Innovations and policy and regulations
to enable the nascent sector on carbon dioxide removal to grow and innovations to engage more people
in our quest to finding and implementing sweeping solutions. We need major breakthroughs
across multiple arenas, and we need it fast. So how do we go about this? Energy Earthshots. The Biden-Harris administration's
Earthshot initiative is inspired by President Kennedy's
Moonshot initiative that aimed to land a man on the moon. I think that's a perfect model
for what we need to achieve here. To achieve the goals
of the Moonshot initiative, the nation needed to establish a new, expansive ecosystem of innovation
in space technologies. It required an all-hands-on-deck approach
that included government, included educators, private sector, industry and, of course, scientists
and engineers and more. Now with the Department of Energy, we're launching a similarly
ambitious effort to enable a portfolio of approaches that range from basic science
to application of science to technology development and for large-scale deployment. These approaches are needed
to balance the benefits, trade offs and limitations of several climate
and clean energy pathways that are needed to accelerate the timeline
for achieving the solutions that we need. We've launched seven Earthshots so far. But as a soil scientist, I'm particularly excited to tell you today
about the Carbon Negative Shot. This shot depends
on a strong science foundation to enable durable, scalable and responsible carbon dioxide
removal from the atmosphere at a cost of less than 100 dollars
per metric ton of CO2 equivalent, including accounting for full life cycle
of emissions within a decade. But we need to be able
to measure and verify it too. Achieving the goals
of the Carbon Negative Shot requires that we advance
and employ nature-based solutions and engineer new technologies. On one hand, we get to learn from nature to enhance the ability of plants
to take up atmospheric CO2 and promote soil carbon sequestration, which we can enable
via land use change and land management. On the other hand, we aim to advance fundamental material
and chemical sciences to develop capabilities for energy-efficient capture
of CO2 from dilute sources. This includes development
of direct air capture sorbents for ambient CO2 and systems that are needed
to durably store the captured carbon. But that's not all we need. We also need a human-centered component
to the Carbon Negative Shot to ensure an equitable transition
towards a decarbonized energy system. We need to make sure
that we realize the full benefits of all these capabilities
we're putting out. And in addition to removing
legacy CO2 from the atmosphere, the goals that we're pursuing
as part of the Carbon Negative Shot also have multiple potential
additional co-benefits, including improving soil health for communities who depend on soil
for their livelihood, reducing air pollution and creation of good jobs. But to realize all these benefits, we need to make sure that people
from all walks of life are at the table when critical decisions are being made
about our climate goals and how we achieve these goals. For me, as an academic, and now a leader for a major
science agency for the nation, this means we need to significantly
revamp our support for broadening participation
efforts in STEM. We need to continue to contribute towards
building a vibrant STEM workforce for the nation. A workforce that will abide
by principles of environmental justice at every step of the process. We need this to make sure
that the science we're enabling works for society. Achieving our global climate goals requires rapid acceleration
of deployment of clean energy and innovations in carbon dioxide removal. I'm convinced the Earthshots
are our best shot for achieving our goals. Just like the Moonshot
landed us on the Moon, ahead of schedule. And any success that we register
on these efforts will not just contribute to removing
legacy CO2 from the atmosphere and halting the climate crisis. It will also contribute
to building a better, more equitable and cleaner world. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #art","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'design', 'social change', 'creativity', 'art', 'history', 'race', 'storytelling', 'Tavares Strachan']",2023-10-05T06:48:31-07:00,2023-10-05T06:48:31-07:00,People & Blogs,"I really love lost stories. So I'm from this very tiny, hot island in the middle of the Caribbean
called Nassau. Has anyone here ever heard of it? Yeah? I distinctly remember the place
being so small that I could land there, shout from the airport, my brothers would somehow hear me and they would know
to come and pick me up. (Laughter) The North Pole, however, is an inhospitable frozen tundra
that's incredibly difficult to get to. Not to surprise any of you, but I am the first Bahamian presumably
to set foot on the North Pole. (Applause) It's true. (Applause) Now, if you were to speak to my parents
about what I was like growing up, they would tell you
that I was mischievous, precocious, the kid devouring all the information and never, ever taking a no for an answer. But if you got them into a secret room, they would also tell you that I was
a pain in the butt and a troublemaker. Early in my practice, it was important for me
to create an artwork that would share the sense of vastness that I'd experienced in the Arctic
with my community. So on a second expedition, I decided to move
this 4.5-ton piece of ice from this frozen Arctic river and bring that to my neighborhood. (Laughter) I'd work with a team
of scientists and engineers, and together we would install
this block of ice in a solar-powered freezer unit
outside of my childhood classroom on this 100-degree day. Now, the response was a mix
of excitement and wonder. The folks in my neighborhood
had never really seen ice quite like this. It was my way of telling the story
of our deep connections to each other. Now, while all of this was going on, I realized I was having a separate
journey of discovery. It was on this expedition
where I began to hear whispers of an unknown polar explorer
named Matthew Henson. Now, up until this point, the fact that the first person
to set foot in the North Pole looked like me, had me aghast. I mean, come on, look at this guy. (Laughter) In 1909, Henson, and fellow
explorer Robert Peary, had done what no others
had done up to that point. They had made it to the North Pole. Now, this son of a sharecropper
had managed over seven Arctic expeditions. Yet his massive, massive contributions
became lost to history. And I ain't really cool with that. So since this lightning-bolt moment, my work became a quest
to tell these lost stories. And to tell all of you the truth,
if you really pay attention, you start to see these
lost stories all around you. And when you find them, you realize that they can speak
with a very loud mouth. Now growing up, my grandparents'
house was the place where my entire Bahamian family would meet every Sunday for Sunday dinner. Now I've got a big family, so, 13 aunts and uncles and 52 cousins
would all squeeze into my grandparents' tiny home. And for sure the house was small, but it was a sanctuary
filled with life and love. Now, I believe I was around 12 years old
when my grandfather came home with the first set of encyclopedias
in our community. This was a big deal. My uncles, who were some big dudes, would never let us get close to these
books without wearing gloves, guys. Can you all believe that? I couldn't wait for my turn
to fan through these pages. And as I would fan through these pages, the questions would arrest me, like, who wrote all of this, and how did they write all of it? And was everything in the entire universe
arrested in these pages? And as I would fan
through this book further, a question really hit me. No one from my community
was in these pages, and if they were missing,
then what else was lost? So years later, with infinite more questions, I decided to make my own encyclopedia. It's called the Encyclopedia
of Invisibility. This is a 3,000-page, leather-bound book that has over 17,000 entries. And yes, it was difficult, but I read every single last one of them. Now, the first entry that I wrote was on, you guys may have guessed it,
the explorer Matthew Henson, the one that I learned about
my first Arctic expedition. From there, I thought, who and what else
should be included in these pages? I would make list after list of things
that were excluded from history and research them. At first, it was just me alone. Then I needed an assistant,
and then I needed an entire team. And together we would comb
the globe looking for people, places and things that were mostly untold. Now this is arranged alphabetically, and the organizing principle
was to try to include the kinds of things that you may not ever learn at school. So let's look at this entry on the Mino. It's a powerful, all-female
military regiment from the Kingdom of Dahomey,
which is current day Benin. Then there's an entry on Robert Smalls. Now the great Robert Smalls
freed himself from slavery, overtook a bunch of Confederate ships, freed a whole bunch of slaves
from those ships, and then majestically marched on to become one of the first
Black congressmen in the United States. Then there's an entry on rhinoceros. Did any of you know
there was a woolly rhinoceros? No? Then there's an entry
on Sister Rosetta Tharpe. Sister Rosetta Tharpe is the mother
of all rock and roll. Then there's an entry on B-movies. Now who can't handle
a high-quality B-movie? Then there's an entry
on the great John Edmonstone, the man that taught
a very young Charles Darwin the art of taxidermy and a whole lot more. To come to think of it,
the only entry missing from this book is an entry that explains how you can put a full pair of socks into a dryer and somehow only one foot comes out. (Laughter) Now, after 12 years, a limited edition of this encyclopedia
was published as an artwork occupying these territories
between sculpture, book and installation. And this experience truly convinced me that there are an infinite amount
of lost stories to be told, and there's no real limits
to how they can be told. So in 2014, I decided to create an artwork in honor of astronaut
Robert Henry Lawrence. Now, Robert Lawrence
was the first Black astronaut. He never realized his dream of space as he was killed in a flight accident
in 1967 at the age of 32. Now, my goal was to honor Robert and to bring his profound legacy to space. Now, those of you who know
anything about space, you would know that that's
easier said than done, because after all,
there ain’t a bunch of island folks walking around with rockets
in their back pockets. So step one was to find
someone with a rocket. And who has rockets? The head of SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell. And then I had to figure out
who was going to be as interested in these
lost stories as I was. The head of SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell. We were introduced by the LA County Museum and after four years of rigorous
testing, planning and sculpting, a satellite was produced
in honor of Robert. Now, this satellite was made of gold, and it was important for me to have this satellite follow an ancient
Egyptian tradition of storytelling by imbuing the essence
of a person into a container. Now, this satellite was called Enoch, after the story
of a mythological character whose walk with the gods was so close that he never, ever died. On November 30, 2018, Enoch blasted into space in the belly of a SpaceX
Falcon 9 rocket into orbit. Almost 50 years after his passing, the legacy of Robert Henry Lawrence
is celebrated amongst the stars. (Applause) Now, I've spent my entire life
being obsessed with these lost stories. Can these lost stories hold the key
that unlocks our sense of belonging? Lost stories definitely need to be told. Not in small ways. But in ways that match the ambitions
of the people that we speak for. Now, I know all of you
have access to lost stories, so please, let's not let them be lost forever. Even if that means you're called
the pain in the butt or a troublemaker. And thank you. (Applause)"

look up in time to notice that the darkness still has a little daylight
left to swallow I will ivy up the fire escape to catch whatever embers of the day are still slow dying behind New Jersey and last week through the fog of my loneliness I realized the living room was slippery pink which I knew meant a light show must be on display so with a quickness I reserve
for emergencies I scampered to the roof and sure enough an explosion of upside-down clementine cotton candy cloud wisps was tie-dyeing the Hudson River neon and I swear I am not a lightweight but I was colordrunk immediately dizzy with gasp and skyward-reaching hoping my fingers might find a bell I could ring that would summon all of New York City to look up! and west! but there was no bell and no one to call just my own astonishment still willing to answer
after the first ring how predictable:
one good sunset and I release my nihilism like rose petals behind a bridal gown look I have married my cynicism and renewed my vows but it didn’t stop the streetlights from coming on at the exact moment
I passed beneath them when nobody else
was in the park to see it like the whole city was winking and yes I blushed the way I do whenever someone
beautiful flirts with me I haven’t stopped thinking about death I am just wringing every last jaw-drop from the tissue between heartbreaks On a long run outside the city along a highway and miles from any shoreline I found a starfish alone on the asphalt an unsolvable mystery with no witness to corroborate and there I was again wandering the streets of Bewilderville: Population 1 what else could I possibly do but swing wide the doors of my delight to this patron saint of unbelonging fragile and whole and so far from home if you too have been
the one nobody asked to dance I’ve got a starfish
I’d love to introduce you to and I don’t have any proof but one time the wind or my ancestors or unseasonal warmth carried three hawks to my kitchen windowsill to rattle my coffin to cocoon and two of them left but one of them stayed eyed me through the glass like a promise or a dare and so lately I am trying to pick up when the universe calls (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #shipping","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'global issues', 'nature', 'energy', 'resources', 'Countdown', 'ocean', 'collaboration']",2023-08-31T04:00:41-07:00,2023-08-31T04:00:41-07:00,Science & Technology,"Lindsay Levin: We’ve just
heard from Maersk, just one of the players
that you deal with. Why is a center like yours needed? Bo Cerup-Simonsen: Because we're looking
at a massive systemic change. It’s huge, and it needs to happen fast. No country, no company, no matter how large and powerful,
can do this alone. So collaboration is going to need
to be a part of the solution. And our center is all about that. It is all about collaborating
across the ecosystem, across the value chain in order to accelerate the transition. What Maersk is doing
is absolutely exemplary, but few companies have the resources and have the courage
to do what Maersk is doing. So you can say it's moving, it's scaling too slowly, when you look
at the industry-wide perspective. So what we really need to do
is to turn those first-mover activities, those leading activities, into industry-wide practices. And so this is what
we're doing in our center, this is what we're aiming to do. And when the center was established,
about three years ago, with a large philanthropic donation
from the A.P. Moller Foundation, the basic idea was that we need to create
a completely new way of collaborating across the ecosystem. The basic idea was that we need
to establish an independent center that would have no vested interest. We need to collaborate with governments
and with companies across the globe, across the ecosystem, and we wanted to establish
a team co-located so that economists and engineers and so on
would sit side by side and imagine the future
and develop the solutions. So this was the idea. And of course there were a lot of concerns
about compliance and antitrust and IP and confidentiality
and practicalities. But we have found a model now, we have overcome those challenges. And now, today, we have more
than 100 organizations across the globe joining the center. Many are sending people to
our team in Copenhagen. Competitors are sitting side by side to develop the solutions of the future. LL: So that's fabulous. Give us a sense of where
and why we're still lagging. BCS: Well, if you look three
or five years back, I think we were lagging
on the technology side, we were lagging on the commercial side, we were lagging on the regulatory side. But over just the past few years, and you just saw
an amazing example of that, we've seen tremendous development
in the space of technology. So now, just over the next
one to two years, we will see container ships,
like what you just saw, we'll see tanker vessels, big bulk carriers,
cruise ships, car carriers being built and getting in the water,
running on new types of fuels. For example, methanol, methane,
ammonia a little later. So this is now all maturing, and the technical readiness
level is really high. So the big focus now
is on the commercial readiness, on the upscaling opportunity
and the barriers for that. And there, we're looking
at two categories of drivers and also two areas
that we have to focus on. And one is a purely market-driven one
where a customer demands a green product, a car, for example, an electric vehicle, and that has to be produced. And that supply chain needs
to work in a green manner. So that is driving now
a part of this transition. As we just heard, it's just that on the industry-wide scale,
it's not moving fast enough. But then we have the regulatory side, and here we've just had
a major breakthrough in the International
Maritime Organization. So just about a week ago,
all 175 countries came together. They agreed. We had Asia with China, we had Europe, we had US, we had Africa. Everybody agreed that we need
to update our strategy. We need global regulation for shipping, we will go to zero by around 2050, we will use sound
technical measures to go there, and we will use economic measures
like a carbon pricing. So that is now a global framework
that has been agreed across the globe. So it's a fabulous fundament
for moving forward from here. LL: Yeah, so congratulations
to all of those involved in that. (Applause) What's still difficult
and what are the opportunities? BCS: So it's still difficult going forward because we're looking at a massive
change on a systemic level and a massive change on individual level. So a shipowner is looking
into an uncertain future. It's much easier to quantify
the additional cost and the additional risk than it is to quantify
the additional opportunities or the risk of not doing anything. So that means a lot of companies and a lot of countries
are stuck with this uncertainty and are hesitant to move forward. A ship owner will be hesitant because she doesn't know
which fuel type to bet on or if the customers will pay. A country, for example,
a developing country, is hesitant because it's concerned about increased
cost of imported goods or how export competitiveness
will influence workplaces and so on. So this is a lot of uncertainty in there. And this is where we work as a center
to address all those uncertainties and those risks and remove those so that decision makers can move forward. LL: So finally, give us an example
of a specific thing that the center is doing to help affect
that kind of change. BCS: So one of the great things, or one of the things that we've had
a lot of interest in recently, is to work with green corridors. A green corridor is the realization
of that new business system. So we work, for example,
a lot with the Chilean ministries and we've worked a lot
with stakeholders in Chile to understand how Chile
can produce renewable energy, how they can turn that into fuels, how they can retrofit their ports, how ship-owning companies
can transport using green fuels, and how, for example, the Chilean mining industry
can transport copper with zero carbon transportation so that they can export green copper
that can be used in, for example, electric vehicles in the future, and thereby support the production
of these green supply chains. So green corridor is really getting
all those stakeholders together across the entire chain. It is reimagining,
you can say, the future, putting that new business system in place, defining how that new business,
what it looks like. And we are right now,
for example in Chile, brought that all the way forward
to feasibility study. So it's very concrete now. And then we take that learning
and we turn it into a general blueprint and we share that with the world
so that every region, everybody can go in and use this cookbook
for how to develop a green corridor. And I think this is our way of working. We try to identify the decision makers
that can really make this move. And then we work specifically
with those leaders, both on company level, so this is typically at strategy,
leadership level, or in country government level, to understand what do they need
in order to move forward. So in addition to the green corridors, we've developed a number
of guidelines and services, how a ship owner
should invest in new ships, how a country should support
the development of future regulation, etc. So this is our way of working. LL: Fabulous, Bo, thank you very much
for the work that you're doing. I know that there's going to be
a lot of people here in other industries that want to learn from your example. Thank you for being with us. BCS: Thank you very much. (Applause)"

spend 16 billion hours on unpaid care work -- cooking for their families,
cleaning up after them, caring for children and older relatives and all the other routine household tasks. These activities are happening all day,
at every hour, in every country around the world. But because many
don't get paid for this work, most of us take it for granted. [The Way We Work] Care work is a catch-all term
for all the tasks and chores that are done in service of other people. Some care work is paid, like medicine,
nursing or being a nanny, but a tremendous amount is done for free. And this unpaid care work
is overwhelmingly done by women. There have been so many
women in my own life who provided both paid
and unpaid care work. My mother and my grandmother before her. Eswari, who was nursing
my grandmother in her final years. Patricia, who cares for my children
when I travel for work. And I've been an unpaid caregiver, too, caring for my immediate family, but also spending several months
caring for ailing friends, their children and my dad in his last days. I've come to realize that unpaid care work makes all other work possible. During the COVID pandemic, with the closure of schools
and the strain on the health care system, the amount of time spent on unpaid care
and domestic work doubled for working parents. This has been a disaster
for women around the world. Compounding the stress and pushing millions out of the paid
labor market altogether. It set the clock back
on progress by decades. But at the same time, the pandemic also made care work visible. It showed up in the background
of our Zoom calls and in our need to limit overtime. And so many workplaces
were able to integrate and even celebrate this new reality. Right now, we have
an incredible opportunity to recognize the care work in our lives,
reframe it for ourselves and build workplaces that are much
more accommodating of it. And here's where we can start. If you are someone providing care, the biggest thing you can do is name it
for yourself and for others. Care work. It's not a distraction if you're fitting it
around paid employment. You're not ""taking a break"" if you’re on sabbatical
caring for someone in need. This is real, critical work that can be exhausting,
frustrating and even boring. Give yourself permission to feel
all of the emotions you'd feel if the work came
accompanied by a paycheck. And when you're talking
to your manager about it, don't feel like you need to apologize. Remember, this is a fact of life, and be as explicit as you can
about your needs. Do you need three months at home or do you need Tuesday mornings
for a standing appointment? As a caregiver, it's also important to recognize
the skills that you gain doing this work. There is so much involved
with giving care -- handling transport, logistics, interpreting medical charts,
managing financials. These are valuable skills that are relevant
to all kinds of contexts. So if you have a job, frame caregiving
to your colleagues that way. And if you’re looking for paid work, don't treat it as a big empty
gap in your life. Put it on your CV and outline the skills
that you've gained from it. Skills like multitasking, project management or communication. But of course it's not just on individuals to change how the wider world
thinks about care work. We need systemic change
from employers, too. The biggest thing that employers can do is to make space for employees
to talk about care work without being penalized or seen
as less focused or dedicated. Caregiving should be a topic
that's brought up early when new employees
first start their training. Workplaces should track and understand
the kind of care work employees are responsible for and what kind of policy changes
are needed to make their lives better and more productive. And employers should make sure
that caregivers aren't passed over for key projects or promotions
just because of their duties at home. Caregiving is such a fundamental
aspect of being human, and yet it's so artificially cleansed
from our work lives. Instead of treating it like a secret, workplaces can bring it out into the open. And of course, workplaces
need to offer flexibility to accommodate the lived
realities of caregivers. For employees who are parents, in addition to parental leave, this means allowing them time off
when kids are sick or home from school. It means letting them establish
dark zones in their calendar around school drop offs,
bath time, bedtime rituals and respecting those boundaries. It means offering remote work options. For people caring for elders
or those who are sick or disabled, this means giving them
reasonable amounts of leave. It means building projects that are based
on milestones and deliverables, rather than relying on frequent
meetings and check-ins alone. It means being really flexible about when and where the work gets done. And workplaces often thrive as a result. And one final point. Care work is one of the fastest-growing
sectors of our economy. As a result of a growing
and an aging population, over two billion people in the world
will need care by 2030. This means that the time is now to shift
the way we think about caring for them. This aging population
is going to need support. They're going to need new solutions. This means innovations,
jobs, new industries. And where many other
jobs are lost to automation, the one job that we're so uniquely
good at as humans is caring for other humans."

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'social change', 'activism', 'trees', 'resources', 'Audacious Project', 'Africa', 'nature', 'community']",2023-07-24T04:00:01-07:00,2023-07-24T04:00:01-07:00,Science & Technology,"I would love to introduce you
to three remarkable women I know. Meet Jane Maigua,
Charity Wangui and Loise Maina. Now, these three women
are restoration champions. They started a company six years ago
in my hometown of Nairobi, purchasing macadamia nuts from farmers, processing them and selling them
around the world. Today, Exotic EPZ is in partnership
with 9,000 farmers across the country. Imagine for a minute
the tree-growing movement these women could catalyze across Kenya. Now here's another group
of women that I absolutely adore. These are the women of Maragua. These women are discovering
the wonders of bamboo. They are planting bamboo and sharing
across their communities. They're using bamboo for entrepreneurship. They're using bamboo for restoration,
and they're using it for firewood. Now these restoration champions
have something in common. They are using nature to reduce poverty, accelerate the re-greening of Africa and secure livelihoods. Now, this is part of the AFR100 Movement an Africa-wide initiative to restore
100 million hectares of land by 2030. All on a continent where we know
60 percent of soils are degraded. And this is only the beginning because the restoration
potential in Africa is 750 million hectares, equal to the size landmass of Australia. And this on a continent
where 60 percent of the land is degraded. Now, why is this important? This is because restoration
breaks the cycle of degradation. It is at once about climate mitigation and cushioning communities against
the worst impacts of climate change. My organization, the World
Resources Institute, is working with AFR100 very closely. We are helping them to raise resources
needed for restoration, to accelerate the establishment
of sound policies so that restoration is incentivized. And also establishing
platforms like this one, so restoration champions
have the platforms and there’s training that they need to accelerate restoration. Now without these local leaders, local wisdom, local knowledge and the passion that drives
restoration champions, scaling restoration
on the African continent would virtually be impossible. Now, my name is Wanjira Mathai,
and I have a personal connection to trees. When we were growing up,
my brothers and I, our mother, Wangari Mathai, who founded the Green Belt Movement and won the 2004 Nobel
Peace Prize for this work -- (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) She spent hours sharing just how beautiful Kenya was
when she was growing up. The river’s, crystal clear. The hillsides and valleys,
covered in forests. The plains were teeming with wildlife
and the soils, she would say, produced the most delicious
sweet potatoes and vegetables. Hunger was virtually unknown. By the 1970s, a lot had changed. Landscapes were already degraded,
rivers were silted with precious topsoil. The plains were already
losing their wildlife, and the soils were largely degraded. Now, half a century on, and the process of degradation
has only accelerated. And not only in Kenya. 27 of the 40 most climate-vulnerable
countries in the world are found on the African continent. And hunger and drought, for those farmers, 60 percent of them
who live on the African continent, is an everyday occurrence. But why is this important? Why is this important? Because restoration reverses
and breaks the cycle of degradation. And there is hope. Because here is an example, the Green Belt Movement. The Green Belt Movement is an example
of a restoration champion in Kenya. 50 million trees planted
by a network of 5,000 women today. And they do this by organizing
themselves into groups, generating tree nurseries,
collecting seeds themselves that they sow, generate seedlings and plant
on public land and private land. This is the genius
of restoration champions. Now, I have seen this work firsthand
in a forest not too far from where I live, the Aberdare Forest. This is one of my favorite forests. A few years ago it was degraded, but thanks to the pioneering work
of the Green Belt Movement and many others like them, this forest has largely been restored. And I love spending time in this forest because as far
as the eye can see are trees. You could almost see them drawing out
carbon dioxide and pumping out oxygen, holding on to precious topsoil. And the crystal clear waterfalls that supply the rivers of Nairobi, the city where I live. AFR100 will take practices like these
across the African continent and replicate them not merely to halt deforestation, but to reverse it. Because that's what is needed. Now, it's not uncommon for people to say that initiatives like those
supported by AFR100 are too small or too risky
for meaningful investments. But our work at AFR100 shows that not only are these initiatives
economical and transformative, they make financial sense. Our research also shows
that initiatives like these that are locally led and managed are 20 times more likely
to deliver long-term success. And they are also more likely to deliver
economic and environmental benefits. So if we invest in initiatives
like Tilaa in Ghana, AFR100, the Green Belt movement, GreenPort in Kenya and ARCOS in Rwanda, they will in turn invest in thousands
and thousands of restoration champions who will restore their landscapes and restore their livelihoods. Now, this is exactly the sort of inclusive
transformation we need to see across the African continent. Now all my life, I was made acutely aware of just how precious
green vegetation truly is. Nature is the source of everything good my mother would tell me all the time. You see, this vision we have
to re-green the African continent, it's not only possible, it is vital. It is our life support system. Now, many of us here despair
that we are the generation that is destroying the planet. But we don't have to be. We can be the restoration generation. Thank you. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #energy","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'Countdown', 'Climate change', 'environment', 'green fuel', 'green shipping', 'fossil fuels', 'clean fuel', 'global issues', 'nature', 'resources']",2023-08-30T08:53:44-07:00,2023-08-30T08:53:44-07:00,Science & Technology,"Lindsay Levin: Welcome,
we're excited to have you here, and one of the things we're very keen
to do with Countdown is to follow up on stuff
and find out how our promises fare. And I know that Maersk,
I believe it's correct to say that your greenhouse gas emissions,
as a global business, are greater than that of Denmark,
where you're based. So you're a big part of the challenge. So tell us, how's it going? Morten Bo Christiansen:
Thanks for having us. And yeah, so we have this dream or vision of decarbonizing our heavy-emitting
business by 2040, so over the next 17 years. And I think some find that
almost ridiculously ambitious. (Laughs) We find it quite exciting. And what is even more exciting
is that we're actually starting to do it, we're actually part
of making the dream come true and implementing solutions
in our business. And let me just share some facts with you. So over the last two years, we have ordered 25 container ships
that can sail on green methanol, which is our choice of green fuel. It's a fuel that can be made
from either renewable electricity or sustainable biomass. 19 of those are being
produced as we speak. The first one, we took delivery
of three days ago, so it's happening. We also just announced the first retrofit
of an existing oil vessel that can, in the future,
also burn green methanol so we can learn how to do that. On the land side, we are building green warehouses,
we are electrifying our terminals. We have 425 heavy-duty electric trucks
coming into our US market, 58 already deployed, some of which actually just across
Lake Michigan, in Chicago. We have 25 coming into Germany. So, you know, lots and lots
of things happening to actually make that a dream come true
that Jim spoke about two years ago. LL: So, progress. This is progress? MBC: Yeah, and it better be. Global logistics account
for 11 percent of all emissions, so all the trucks and ships and planes
and warehouses and ports. So we have work to do. LL: So tell us about this first new ship. MBC: I can do better than telling,
I can actually show you. I think we have a video of it. There it is. So this is not a rendering,
this is real steel. And we took delivery of this ship Sunday, and next Sunday, it's going to do the first bunkering
of green methanol in Ulsan, in South Korea. Then, she's going to head out
with our well-trained Maersk crew to set out for Shanghai, to pick up cargo. She's going to stop over in Singapore, in Port Said, and in Rotterdam,
to pick up more green methanol, because she has to make it
halfway around the world to arrive in Copenhagen
on September 13th for name-giving. And then, she will be deployed
in the Baltic Sea for operation. LL: I can see we've got
a beautiful map of that route. MBC: Yeah, and if I can -- This is just one ship, right? And, for those who know container ships, this is actually a rather small one. But that's really not the point here. I think the point
is that this thing is real, right? It's happening. And not least, it is the first of many. We hear a lot of talk
about exponential change, and how we need that. And I'll give you
some exponential data points. So three years ago,
there were none of these ships on order, not a single one. Two years ago, there was one. That one -- oh, sorry, this one. (Laughs) One year ago, there was 23; 19 of those were ours. Today, we have
120 of these ships on order. There are now five
major container carriers who have started ordering these ships, and a couple of feeder
providers as well. So that's exponential change, but I think that's exactly what we need
to shift this industry. LL: Yeah. (Applause) LL: And there’s kind
of a chicken-and-egg problem. You need the fuel,
the ship, the ship design. Are you breaking away from this? Where do you start -- chicken and egg? MBC: Yeah, I think the chicken
has met the egg, or whether it's the egg
that met the chicken? (Laughs) I mean, this is a supply challenge, right? We need to scale production
of green methanol, because it’s important. It needs to be green methanol, not the conventional methanol
made from fossil fuels. And that really is a challenge. Just to put that,
a bit, into perspective -- we have 740 ships at Maersk. If all of those were to sail
on so-called e-methanol, so methanol made
from renewable electricity, we would need somewhere
between five and six percent of all wind and solar produced today
in the entire world. LL: Just for your business?
MBC: Yes. MBC: So I think that the magnitude of this
is almost mind-blowing. But I think that's just
all the more reason to get started. LL: So that scale, that magnitude,
very daunting -- is that holding people back,
different players in the industry? It's just too much? MBC: I think there's, of course,
the enormity of the challenge, I think that goes for any part
of decarbonization, right? But I think, for shipping, particularly, there’s a lot of uncertainty around what’s the winning technology, right? Because there's this green methanol,
that's one solution. You have green ammonia,
you have green methane, you have liquified hydrogen, electrification, even nuclear. So there's this fear, I think, of making the wrong bet
or getting it wrong, somehow. Of course, in an ideal world, we would spend a decade figuring out
all the pros and cons and what is best. But we need to address
this problem now, right? And honestly, there is no
magic bullet here. All these solutions can work,
I think they will work. They all have their pros and cons. But we just need to get on with it. LL: And you've chosen methanol
as your fuel of choice. Why is that? MBC: It's very simple --
it works, and it works now. (Laughter) (Applause) LL: It works, it works now, and these green fuels
are still more expensive, because we've got to build up the volume. Talk to us a little bit
about the price issues. MBC: It almost sounds too easy, right? And it really isn't,
because one of the big challenges is, of course, that these fuels
are more expensive. So if we take fuel
at the current oil price, green methanol can easily be twice,
even three times the price. So that's of course quite a bit. And of course, somebody
needs to pay the bill. Who needs to pick up that bill? At the end of the day,
I guess it's all of us, as consumers, because it’s our consumption
that creates the emissions. And the interesting thing is, when you check it
through the value chain, it really dilutes. So if you double up the fuel price,
that sounds crazy, right? Well, that means the freight rate
goes up 10 to 15 percent. And if you take a pair of shoes
or an item like that, that's, like, five cents. And there's actually
a quite interesting study by the Boston Consulting Group that shows that most consumer products
can be made with a net-zero footprint, so no emissions in production, at a cost of somewhere
between one and four percent. So that's really
what we are talking about -- LL: So that doesn't sound too bad. MBC: No, I think many of us
could afford that, right? I mean, it's one year's inflation,
it's really what it is. But the problem is that, if all the cost gets stuck
at one place in the value chain, then things don't move, right? If you're a fuel producer, and you're producing a product that is two or three times
the price of your fossil competitor, few would dare do that, and nobody would get
any financing for it, right? So these fuel producers, they look to the shipowners
to make long-term offtake agreements, and we do that. I mean, last year at Maersk,
we spent eight billion dollars on fuel, so doubling or tripling that, that’s a pretty scary outcome. So we need to figure out
how we can then turn to our customers, and have them pay a green premium, and they do. So I think that's really
what we need to do, we need to get these partnerships
across the value chain so that we stand together
and we just de-risk the thing. Because when you de-risk, speed goes up. And what we have done so far
is we have talked to a lot of developers, we have signed up for the ship
that we just saw, 10 years worth of fuel for that one. And for the other ones, we have around 30 percent
on letters of intent for our expected consumption by 2030. So that's how we are trying to lean out
and lend our balance sheet. LL: So you're giving confidence
to the value chain. MBC: We're basically taking out
commercial risk on these projects. And then we, of course,
need to turn to our customers to figure out how they can
either pass that onto us as consumers or somehow create value from that. That's really the challenge we have. LL: Morten, thank you very much. Great to listen to you, and we wish you well
with the rest of the journey. MBC: Thank you.
LL: Thank you very much."

#TED #TEDTalks #farming","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'environment', 'science', 'sustainability', 'food', 'community', 'agriculture', 'farming', 'Countdown']",2023-10-25T04:00:47-07:00,2023-10-25T04:00:47-07:00,Science & Technology,"Jim Whitaker: I grew up on a family farm. My family's been farming for 130 years
in southeast Arkansas, and I'm a fifth generation farmer. We raise cotton, rice, corn and soybeans, along with my brother Sam, our extended families and a lot of great coworkers,
could not do it without them. So when I was 16 years old, I came home from school one day. It was my dad's birthday. My birthday was three days later. I expected in some type of party event. But my dad had just went through
the historic 1980 drought, and when I got home that day,
my mom was crying, my dad was trying to console her, and there's a foreclosure
letter on the bar. We thought we were going
to lose the family farm that we had had in our family
for generations. Luckily, we did not lose the farm, but he still struggled financially. When I was 22 years old,
after a little time in the army, I decided I was going to start farming. So my brother and I rented a farm. My dad couldn't help us,
he didn't have the finances. He could not help us get started. Farming is very
capital-intensive business. And so we got an FHA
beginning farmer loan. And let me tell you something
about renting a farm when you're 22 years old. No one rents you a farm
unless no one else wants to rent it. (Laughter) It was a big piece of land,
it was cash rent. I mean, the stakes were set. We were doomed to fail. And we weren't focused on environmental
sustainability back then. We were focused
on economic sustainability. How do we make higher yield,
how do we use less fertilizer? How do we get to the next year
and feed our family? And ... It happens that economic and environmental
sustainability go hand in hand along with social sustainability. As we used less fertilizer,
used less water, our yields started going up. It was just a great thing. So one of the first things
we did on our rice fields, we adopted a technique
that's a little different. We leveled our fields completely flat. This is called zero-grade. Rice all over the world
is grown in a flooded environment. Everywhere. And most people use
the natural contour of the Earth to cascade the water down
and let the water flow downhill. And there are always,
we call it continuous flood. They continuously
put water on their fields. And we leveled ours flat
with a perimeter road. And what that perimeter road
lets us do is capture rainfall. So we actually pump less water,
we are able to use less water, we have less runoff, less erosion,
less nutrients leaving our field. Nothing leaves our field
unless we want it to. So I get around farmers and I tell them about potential
carbon credits and other things, and our family was lucky, we were one of the first ever in the world to sell agricultural carbon credits
in 2016 to Microsoft using this protocol that we've designed on rice. And I got that -- Let me just back up a little bit
and tell you how I got that. I didn't get that on my own. I met two very instrumental people. One was Dr. Merle Anders. He is the world-renowned
greenhouse gas expert, and he started mentoring me. The other was a buyer from Mars Foods, and we were in a leadership
class together. And we started talking and we started
thinking about sustainability. So that's how my journey started. But you know, when I tell other farmers that they could potentially
sell carbon credit, they could help companies reduce
their scope 3 emissions, they could save money, possibly enroll in environmental
climate-smart practices for the government, they say, ""I'm just trying to get by."" Farming is a generational business. People have been doing things,
passed down father to son, father to son. And you'll see, father
to daughter, here in a minute. It's passed down generationally, and we only get one chance a year
to make a mistake. So when you tell people about doing things
that are outside their norm, it scares the heck out of them. So I found a different way
of talking to them about it. I say, ""Well, you know,
you could save 40 to 50 dollars on your pumping cost. You could sell a carbon credit. You could get paid more
by a company for doing the right thing."" This starts to pique their interest. Risk mitigation is how we're going
to get farmers involved. We are a for-profit industry, so they're not going to do anything
that they think hurts their yields. So Jessica, went to college, got a business degree,
a sustainability minor, went on to get her MBA,
emphasis on finance. Now she's back helping me. Not all the time on the family farm. She works for Ducks Unlimited, one of the most aggressive
conservationists in the rice industry. They are an awesome partner to work with. She's back working with Ducks Unlimited, but she's been helping me with protocols
and data collection. One of the things
that I wanted to figure out was, number one: What’s important? How are we going to quantify it? And then how are we going
to sell that data? Because everyone here wants to know,
""Can we have your data?"" No, you can't. (Laughter) (Applause) Anyway, so we're trying to figure out
how to quantify that. So we established what is called
the Smart Rice protocol. We partner with a global
seed company, RiceTec, and we have one of the first ever -- there's a couple more -- I promise you it's the most rigorous, but we have one of the first ever
third-party verified, sustainable rice packages
that hit the market a few months ago, and we’re trying to get
in retail locations. And then we’re also helping some major
end users with their scope 3. And I think that's going to be the future. But Jessica's role in growing rice
is much different than mine, and she's part of the next generation
to come take over our family farm. (Applause) Jessica Whitaker Allen:
I'm a sixth generation farmer. Growing up, I remember
running around outside barefoot, catching as many snakes,
turtles, frogs as possible, and then trying to convince my parents
to let me keep them inside as pets. (Laughter) Eventually, my dad bought me an aquarium, and we had fun with that
for a little while inside until a few of the snakes
got lost in our house and we never found them. Sorry. (Laughter) We live and work in southeast Arkansas. McGehee, specifically. Our town has 4,000 residents
and one stoplight. The nearest airport, Starbucks,
shopping mall, Whole Foods, is two hours away in any direction. Without places like this
and farmers like us, you'd be hungry, naked and sober. (Laughter) (Applause) I sometimes jokingly say
that I have three, sometimes four full-time jobs, but I really have three
or four full-time jobs. My day job is as a conservation
coordinator with Ducks Unlimited under the Rice Stewardship Partnership. I work alongside rice farmers to protect, restore and manage wetlands for waterfowl. Waterfowl spend a lot of time
in rice fields, by the way. I’m also a wife, mother, and I do anything and everything I can
for our family farm. The last one doesn't pay the bills, but it's hard to say no to my dad. So when he sent me an email
about a grant he was interested in a little over a year ago, I got to work. My dad releases the butterflies
and I have to catch them. I have to figure out
how to do what's going on, whatever is in his mind. He's the thinker, I'm the doer. This grant specifically
was the USDA's partnerships for climate-smart commodities. I submitted a proposal
on behalf of our farm, and it was successfully selected. We are going to work with farmers
in southeast Arkansas to educate them about the benefits
of growing sustainable rice. We're going to work
with veterans, immigrants, limited-resource and socially
disadvantaged farmers. Farmers that aren't so different
from my family just a few generations ago. We will then implement pay-for-practices such as alternate wetting and drying,
cover crop, no till and low till. We will then help them learn about and document their
greenhouse gas benefits. Monitor, measure, report and verify them. Then market and sell
that rice, at a premium, to help them realize the benefits
of producing sustainable rice. The economic advantage. I'm a farmer, but not
in the way you might think. I don’t drive the tractors,
and I don’t plant the rice. But I know how to take
what my dad has learned and what he is doing
and share that with others. I know how to interpret the data and see the reduction in inputs that has both an economic
and an environmental impact. I don't know if that alone is enough
to stop climate change, but I'm surrounded by farmers
that are doing everything they can to be more sustainable. I think my brother and I
will take over the farm someday if my dad lets us. And hopefully when my son is old enough, I'll take him out on the farm
and show him what I do. I'll tell him he can go do
whatever he wants to do, and hopefully one day I'll see him
back on the farm, the seventh generation. But for that to happen, we need a sustainable farming industry, one that rewards trailblazers
and early adopters instead of penalizing them. Farmers like my family who are on the front lines
of sustainable rice production. JW: So Jessica mentioned
alternate wetting and drying. And I think in my haste, I left it out. So let me tell you what it is. It is when we flood a rice field
continuously, like my dad taught us, we put four inches of water on it. We have an evaporation rate
of about a quarter inch a day, so we have about 16 days
of available water. Rice is an anaerobic crop. It's grown in flooded conditions. When the soil starts to dry, the microbial community goes dormant, and the field stops emitting
methane emissions. Let me tell you why that's important. There are 400 million acres
of rice grown globally. It is the largest emitter of methane gas. It is the largest user
of irrigation water, and our methods, if used, can reduce
greenhouse gas by 50 percent, reduce water use by 50 percent, increase yields to feed a hungry world. (Applause) JWA: If our protocols
were adopted more widely, can you imagine the benefits? If you take care of the planet,
it will take care of you. That's true for farmers and for all of us. Farmers take care of consumers, take care of all of you every single day. It's time for you to start
taking care of farmers. Thank you. JW: Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"

#TED #TEDTalks #technology","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'technology', 'economics', 'social change', 'future', 'aging', 'work', 'human body', 'Piyachart Phiromswad']",2023-10-12T04:00:13-07:00,2023-10-12T04:00:13-07:00,Science & Technology,"So by the year 2050, there are going to be
more than two billion people who are older than 60 years old, and it has been estimated
that around 80 percent of these two billion people will live in low-
and middle-income countries, which is roughly the developing countries. It is currently a common belief, globally, that senior citizens should not work, do not need to work, and therefore, there is no reason
for companies to create jobs for them. I think this kind of thinking, the thinking that senior
employment is inessential, is actually the seed of a major problem
that could impact a lot of lives, especially the lives of people
in developing countries. To explain to you why,
let me show you a diagram, and let me call this diagram
a negative aging spiral. Imagine a 50-year-old
living in a developing country. The chance that this person
will work later on will be slim, so this person is not going
to invest in their skill, might not even invest in their health, because there's no return
from this investment. Then, at the age of 60, this person is going to stop working, because it's a common thing to do
in these countries. And then after that,
many bad things could happen. For example, this person might not
have enough savings, or maybe no savings at all, and now there’s no more
employment opportunity. This person might feel lost,
feel hopeless, feel lonely. This person might even feel like there's no purpose
to continue living. So it seems like, for many people
in developing countries, there's going to be suffering
through the process of population aging. Is there anything we can do differently? For me, as an economist who has been working on this topic
of population aging, especially in the context
of developing countries, for many years, I have been puzzled by these questions, but I think I've got an answer. I think the best catalyst that we can use
to break the negative aging spiral and unlock the power of population aging is to create something called
senior employment technologies and use it to democratize
senior employment. What is senior employment technology? It is a technology that can be used
to reduce or remove physical and cognitive barriers
for work for senior citizens. Like people wearing glasses today, which we use to erase or remove
our vision problem, senior employment technology is something that we can use
to transform senior employment from scarcity to abundance. But unfortunately, this aspect of technology
has been overlooked by a lot of people. When we actually think about it, senior living assistive technologies
are quite common, but not so much in terms
of senior employment technologies. And in the context of,
for example, developed countries, these technologies
do exist to some extent, but in the context
of developing countries, these technologies
are largely nonexistent. So if we could create
senior employment technologies and use our imagination
to think about what it could be, what would it look like? Let me give you guys a couple of examples. The first group of senior
employment technologies is something that can be called
physical augmentation technologies. There are two types
of physical barriers to work. The first one
is physical barriers at work. So as we age, we tend to lose
some of our physical abilities. For example, we lose our muscle strength, we might lose
our hand and finger dexterity. Now, let's imagine the possibility we could create cheap and accessible
exoskeleton technologies, which is a suit that a senior
citizen could wear, and this suit can be used to augment,
for example, trunk muscles, and the senior citizen can actually
use it to lift something heavy, but it doesn't feel that heavy. Now, if we actually think about it, this aspect of technologies
could be pretty important in the context of developing countries, because a lot of people
in developing countries actually use their body
or their labor, a lot, for work. Next, let’s imagine
the possibility we could create cheap and accessible collaborative robots,
or ""cobots"" in short, which is often in the form of robot arms, and these robot arms can be used
as an extra steady hand that a senior citizen could use to recover
their hand and finger dexterity, especially for work
that requires precision. One interesting use case for this could be ... senior surgeons
in developing countries. We can all agree that we wouldn't want
a surgeon with a shaky hand to do anything near our body. But these technologies
can help senior surgeons with amazing skill, amazing knowledge, to still make a significant contribution. And we know, in the period
of population aging, surgeons, doctors
will be in great shortage. The next physical barrier to work is the physical barrier
in getting to work itself. So as we age, things
like getting stuck in traffic or being in congested
public transportation for so long only to take a long walking distance could be a major barrier to work
for many senior citizens. Now, if a job does not require
a physical presence, let’s imagine the possibility that remote
working technology such as Zoom or maybe, in the future, the metaverse, can be used to completely remove
the journey to work itself, and allow senior citizens
to work from anywhere, any time, or maybe any country. If a job does really require
a physical presence, let’s imagine the possibility 
of smart city technologies. One aspect of smart city technology is focused on optimizing
city transportation resources by collecting data, information, from sensors or cameras, and using it to improve the journey
to work for senior citizens so that their journey to work
can be better and safer. The second group of senior
employment technologies is something that can be called
cognitive augmentation technologies. So as we age, we also tend to lose
some of our cognitive abilities. For example, we tend to lose
our ability to memorize things or our abilities to compare
pictures, objects, which is called perceptual speeds. Let’s imagine the possibility that maybe
our cell phone, our laptop or maybe virtual reality glasses can be equipped with cognitive
augmentation software powered by artificial intelligence, which can be used as a companion brain. So in the future, this device
can be used to help senior citizens, senior workers, to show them work-related
information as needed, so they don't need
to memorize everything -- which would be great
for me right now, too -- (Laughter) help enhance, for example,
perceptual speeds when senior workers, senior citizens
need to identify objects or find defects, and they can actually make
the final decision better and faster. Of course, beyond the physical
and cognitive barriers that I have mentioned, we still need to find a way
to remove social barriers to work, which is called ageist beliefs. It's the belief that senior citizens are always less productive
than younger workers for any kind of occupation. I think senior employment technologies
can take us one step closer to removing, or maybe
significantly reducing ageist beliefs. I think if we can do this thing,
we can break the negative aging spiral and create something that can be called
a positive aging spiral. Imagine a 50-year-old
living in a developing country, but in this case, this person
actually invests in their skill, this person actually invests
in their health, because they know
this investment will be valued. And not only that, this person actually looks forward
to the next journey in their lives. Then at the age of 60,
senior citizens who are qualified to work, or could become qualified to work, because of senior employment technologies, and need or want to work, should be able to work. If we can do this, I think we can achieve and become
a wealthy and healthy aging society. So by using these senior
employment technologies ... When we think about technologies ... some technologies might seem scary, some might seem concerning. But I think senior employment technologies
is the right kind of technology that our world, our society
needs more right now. And we can use
senior employment technologies to transform and democratize
senior employment, from scarcity to abundance. And I think we can use it to transform
the lives of many people from suffering through the process
of population aging to flourishing in the process
of population aging. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

#TED #TEDTalks #renewableenergy","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'global issues', 'energy', 'solar energy', 'wind energy', 'Audacious Project', 'Countdown', 'renewable energy', 'Rebecca Collyer']",2023-09-20T04:00:19-07:00,2023-09-20T04:00:19-07:00,Science & Technology,"David Biello: So tell me about ReNew2030. Rebecca Colyer: David, ReNew2030 is a coalition of regional climate
foundations, think tanks and NGOs working around the world
to scale wind and solar. Why is this so important
in the fight to protect our climate? Well, because the power sector
is responsible for 50 percent of all the emissions
we need to reduce before 2030. It needs to go first because we need it
to electrify other sectors. We also need to make sure
that the transition is fast. As well as first, it needs to go fast. We've got a window of just seven years. Seven years to see those exponential
curves hit the roof. And it also needs to be fair. We need to make sure
that the communities involved are consulted deeply on the siting
of those renewable energy installations. We need to make sure
that the supply chains and the transition minerals
are equitably sourced. And we also need to make sure
that precious finance flows to where it's needed most. So this is what ReNew2030 does. Powered by philanthropy, it takes the funds to the groups
that need it most in the geographies
where the transition needs the most in order to impact the power sector. DB: So what are the obstacles then? RC: You'd think, with the phenomenal cost
reductions we've seen in renewable energy, that this would just be
a runaway success story. But that's not the case. There are all sorts of non-cost barriers that communities and societies
need to work on. Barriers such as lack of ambition, policy barriers,
such as lack of investment, barriers such as slow
permitting and planning, not just for wind and solar themselves, but also for the grids that we need
to balance them reliably and securely. Barriers like misinformation. In the information wars
we’ve been talking about, there are really serious problems
about misinformation. And of course, skills for workers
and a just transition. So, David, ReNew2030, what it does is it supports groups
and it does so with a set of levers. Levers that are tried and tested to help us work on the transition, policy and advocacy, to name just a few. Narrative building and storytelling. And we do that across the globe, in the geographies that have
the highest emissions, and we support groups
working on those barriers. I want to tell you a little bit more
about some of those groups. Sérgio Xavier works
in the northeast of Brazil. And they're working to advocate
for sustainable energy products. Abdou Ndour, he works in Senegal helping
agricultural workers to access energy. Joojin Kim, he works in South Korea
and he works on policy and finance. And one of my personal favorite partners
that we support is Jeanette Gitobu. She helps female leaders and engineers to enter careers
in the global wind industry. So that’s what ReNew2030 does. It helps bring the power of philanthropy
to the groups that matter the most. DB: That's amazing. But that also makes it sound
like communities are maybe as important as national governments in this? RC: That's right, David. I mean, for many years we've focused
on national governments and they are critical, don't get me wrong, they're really, really important. But communities have incredible power to shape the power system of the future
that we want to see. They can engage in community-owned energy, they can engage in local policy. They can engage in the workforce
as part of a just transition. So communities are central
to the thesis of ReNew2030. DB: OK, so, sounds great, but what makes you think that this collaborative
approach will work? I mean, you've got lots of progress,
but we need exponential change, as you said. RC: We do need exponential change, David. This is what worries me. So we have to collaborate
between businesses, governments and civil society. And we've seen in countries like Uruguay, Denmark, Kenya, many others, that exponential growth is possible. So what ReNew2030 does is it works with a group of regional
climate foundation leaders to bring the funding
to the groups on the ground with the data they need,
the tool kit of strategies and also the ability to convene
together and talk and listen. And ReNew2030 is therefore the thing
that gives me great hope that we can see exponential growth
in the places that we need. DB: I love the sound of that. So when you succeed, what does the world of 2030 look like? RC: We actually need these groups
to create disruptive change. Times five the installation of wind and solar
that we have now by 2030, done in a just and equitable way. So my hope is that by 2030, the work that we do
will have helped put us on a footing for a climate secure, safe future. It's 50 percent of all emissions
we need to get at, remember. So this is very serious. And my hope is that at the same time, we will actually have created
local jobs and clean air. And most importantly for me personally, is that we will have helped
to give communities the opportunity to shape affordable, clean electricity for their homes and their schools and their businesses. Thank you. DB: Thank you. (Applause)"

Pearson: David, it is so
wonderful and fantastic to be here with you. I admire your leadership
in the UK and across the globe for the work that you do, and so many folks in this room
are being inspired by you consistently. When you think about leadership
in this movement for climate justice, how would you characterize
it at this time? David Lammy: So look, I look at this
through the lens of foreign policy. We are in a tough geopolitical moment. We've got the United States,
obviously as the world's superpower, but China rivaling now the United States. We've got the emergence
of these middle states like UAE, where the next COP will be, India and others. And at this moment,
there is a degree of short-termism, particularly as populism enters
politics in northern Europe, in the United States and other places. There is, I think, also a degree of underestimating our populations and social media and other
is driving that. And so I guess there is a tendency to focus
too much on small things and not the big things
that bring us together as we challenge the politics
that divides us and doesn't bring us together. JJP: Yeah. You know, when I think
about this movement and politics, it matters so much to how we act and what happens
in our lives consistently. So I really appreciate that. DL: Thank you. And tell us about your journey
in climate and leadership. JJP: Well, my journey started in Memphis,
Tennessee, the greatest place on Earth. (Cheers) A lot of Memphis folks here, with the Byhalia Connection Pipeline, two multibillion dollar corporations
came to our community, called our community
""the path of least resistance,"" decided they were going to build
a multibillion dollar pipeline while taking Black folks' land and threatening over a million people's
drinking water in the process. And it was that fight at home that got me involved in environmental
and climate justice, realizing that we are not the path
of least resistance for anybody, but we are the path
of resilience for everybody. (Applause) And it is our community's proximity. The folks like Clyde Robinson
and Scottie Fitzgerald, who refused to sell their land, who refused to give in to corporations that were saying
that they were less valuable because they didn't have
titles behind their names. It was that community
that really showed me that every environmental
and climate justice fight is local and it is based in principle and in the people who commit to justice. But those echoes,
they resound pretty loudly even from the quietest places. And what we were able to see
was the voices of people in Boxtown, a community built by formerly
enslaved African Americans helped to launch an environmental
justice movement in Memphis that got great people,
even like Vice President Gore, to come to the hood and advocate
alongside us about a racist, reckless rip off of a pipeline,
as he called it, that was going to destroy our community. And so it was that fight. It was that fight that taught me
about people power, taught me about
the importance of proximity, and that when we fight, we can win. When we fight, we do win. (Applause and cheers) And I think about that, and I think about that in this context of how do we continue
to build this movement? Because you talk about racial
justice and people siloing, you talk about environmental justice
or climate justice and people siloing, but climate justice doesn't get
as much attention as, say, police brutality or other things. Why do you think climate justice
hasn't reached sort of that level yet? DL: Well, look, I think
that's the paradox. So the great story of the 20th century is how so many people
at the beginning of that century, who had no rights, won their rights by the end
of the 20th century. So if you think of women, subjugated, the property of their husbands
or their father and you think of people
like Emmeline Pankhurst, you think of Black and brown people and the work of Martin Luther King
and Gandhi and others. You think of LGBTQ people,
ridiculed, ostracized, and the work of Harvey Milk. You think of disabilities. By the end of the 20th century, people gaining their rights
for the first time. But the danger is, at this point,
that we retreat back into our silos, that it's all about identity politics. And the thing that can connect
the dots is climate justice. All of those communities suffering under the umbrella of the climate
emergency at this point. And so there is this case, if you think about who's crossing
borders and fleeing continents, it's Black and brown people. Who is suffering in northern European,
North American communities? It's Black and brown people
as well as Indigenous people. So we've got to connect the dots now
and join that fight for climate justice. Justin, how do you see that at this point? JJP: I think, you know, if we had cared where the polluters
were placing their factories and their facilities 40, 50, 60 years ago, we wouldn't have the climate
emergency we do now. But see, it was because it was being
placed in lower-income communities. It was because it was being placed
in Indigenous communities and Black communities that people
weren't paying attention. And so our community ends up
with 4.1 times the cancer average. It's become a sacrifice zone,
as Dr. Mustafa Santiago Ali called it. We have sacrificed people in communities
that have been politically, economically deprived, and we've told them that it's their fault. And we've allowed people
across our country and across continents to suffer, although they make the least
amount of pollution. And until we get proximate, until we get close to the people
who are suffering the most and allow that to drive
our decision making, we are going to continue to be
in a very difficult predicament. But I believe that is where transformation and where real opportunity exist for us. It is in lifting up those voices,
it is and bringing those folks from the periphery into the center. And it is only by doing that that we can
really say that we are advocating for climate justice
and environmental justice. And so when you think about building
that type of movement, you've got to have leaders,
but you've also got to have followers. And we've seen a lot of plans
coming out of a lot of big entities that isn't oftentimes
garnering that followership. What do we do about that? DL: Well, look, in terms
of the leadership piece, you've got to have an authentic leadership
that comes from somewhere real. If I look at my own country,
the United Kingdom, many of you will know,
we've had three prime ministers in a very short space of time. We had one who didn't even
want to go to COP last year. We have to be clear. And that's why if my party
wins the next election, I'm praying that we will, we have said there will be no more
drilling for oil in the North Sea. Done, finished, over. (Applause and cheers) It's got to be authentic,
it's got to be real. And we have to step up
and help to lead alongside people. And that means that we
in the United Kingdom have to get back to aid, development, climate,
being out there in the world again. 0.7 percent of GDP, of our money going towards helping
the poorest in the world. We are committed to that as soon
as the fiscal climate allows us to be. That's the kind of leadership we now need. Now, look, a lot of people, a lot of young people
are following your inspiration. So what do you think? JJP: I mean, the first follower -- y'all seen that? -- is an underrated form of leadership. I think that was a good TED Talk. The first followers are the people
who help to build movements. It's the folks who really show up
and who speak up and advocate and show others how to follow. I'm fortunate to be
in the position that I am, but I am not here in and of myself, it's because there's a movement of people, a groundswell of an intergenerational,
multiracial, multi-socioeconomic, multiethnic, multi-sexual orientation
movement of people who are advocating for justice. and that is what is required. It isn't that we have silos, it's that we build a movement
big enough for everybody, everybody in this room, everybody outside this room, everybody that wants to be in this room, everybody that can't be in this room. That is how we build and that is how we grow
and that is how we develop. And we're seeing that in so many
great places in this country, but also around the globe. Dave, talk a little bit about that. DL: There's a lot going on that I see. I'm excited by what is coming
from the fringe into the center. So you start with Amerindian people
asking for their rights, saying, ""Please don't cut down our forests."" You then get this momentum
towards ecocide, which can be as big
as the UN coming together to declare genocide wrong
at the end of the Second World War. Now we see small island states
picking up that issue, countries like France and yes,
we in the opposition, if we form a government, we want an ecocide law to make sure that people
can't cut down our rainforests. You've now got these
initiatives like Bridgetown and Mia Mottley leading that force
in Barbados saying, yes, we have to change global finance. It's time for the big boys to get real about the money that people need
in smaller economies and less developed economies. And then in the country
that my parents are from, Guyana, this is a country that has not
cut down its rainforests, must not cut down its rainforests. It’s hugely important there
in the Amazon basin. And we have to support
those Indigenous people at a time when the country
has discovered oil. And I'm seeing initiatives
there, on the ground, every single day of the week. And I have my own conservation
center, Sophia Point. So right around the world,
things are happening. Yes, we must have outrage, but we must have optimism
as well, it seems to me. Now I turn to you. Here in the United States,
big global superpower, we've got Joe Biden, things have accelerated. What do you see from where you're sitting? JJP: I applaud the Biden
administration on so much. And there's more that we can do
as the United States of America with the amount of resources, power,
the access that we have, we can help to be more of a leader
in solving the climate crisis and declaring a climate emergency. We've seen some progress. The Inflation Reduction Act
put 40 billion dollars dedicated toward environmental
justice in particular. The Justice 40 Initiative dedicated
40 percent of federal resources going to underserved communities
that have been left out of a lot of money
for a long period of time. We're seeing some progress, but then we get a debt
ceiling reduction deal that says the Mountain Valley
pipeline can be expedited because a senator wants that. And so while we have so much
hope in legislation, the reality is it can't stop there. It's the organizers like
Dr. Crystal Cavalier and Jason Keck of the Occaneechi tribe in North Carolina who continue to resist
and who continue to organize because the institutions do not change
in and of themselves. It is what's happening outside of them, it's the people who organize
and who mobilize and who activate. And that is what inspires me
and motivates me so much about the environmental and climate
justice movement in this country. They're going to get us off
this stage pretty soon, David. But as you look
at the leaders of the present and the leaders of the future,
what advice do you have? What recommendation do you have
for how we chart a climate just future? DL: Find the common ground. There are people beyond this room,
beyond this movement, who aren't with the page just yet. So find the common ground. We need less bad faith in politics
and more good faith in politics. And hold these two things. So much that is good
starts on the margins. It starts with rebellion. It starts with campaign. It starts with civil disobedience. But this is also a moment where the climate emergency
is moving into the mainstream. And that is exciting. It's the corner of our economy. It's the corner of our security. It's the corner of our prosperity. So you've got to hold both
at the same time. That is what leadership requires. Let's end with you, come on, add to that. JJP: Well, I think we need
a courageous moral imagination. We know of the world
that is possible that is not yet. We have the vision where everybody
has clean water and clean soil and clean water to drink, and we have to put our God hands
and our God feet and our God heart into this movement. The resistance will always remain, but so will the persistence
of the people who are in this room. And that is what gives me the most
courage and the most hope, not just for ourselves, but for the generations
of people we will not know that will live into that vision
that we create together. And I'm so glad to be a part
of that movement with you and with you, David, I love you. (Cheers and applause)"

We don't know about you, but we are fans of weekends. And social security. And health insurance. And the end of child labor! And all of these workplace protections exist because of the advocacy of labor unions. In this episode, political scientist Margaret Levi shares the long history of organizing labor and explains how unions create equality and protect worker rights. She also discusses her optimism about today's young workforce and why she believes that an equitable future requires a revival of the labor movement.

many strange things about being a comedian one of the biggest is how being paid works I can perform the exact same jokes and get paid wildly different amounts sometimes I go to a conference and I tell my jokes and I get a very lucrative check other times I tell those same jokes at a bar and they give me two free seltzers it's the wild west out there when it comes to joke prices so when I got my first TV writing job I was really surprised to learn that I was now part of a small but powerful Union called The Writer's Guild of America all of a sudden my work included things like minimum weekly rates Health Care contributions a potential pension down the road and rules about how I could be treated by my bosses it was honestly shocking to me the contrast between how much better I was treated all of a sudden it was night and day and also here's a funny little side note when I moved to LA I talked to one of the labor organizers at the union and he told me that the zip code that I had moved into has the densest concentration of unionized comedians in the world so there are people on all sides of me having a similar Revelation right now being in a union and seeing the power and the benefits it's really changed how I think about organizing and Community power because the only reason that the writer's Guild is strong is because the members are willing to stand together and risk losing out on money and work to protect each other whether you are an established TV writer who is already well into their career or someone just starting out like me so in today's episode we're going to dive deep into the history power and promise of Labor organizing it's a topic that has been in the news quite a bit lately but many people still have kind of an outdated idea of what a union is and while garment steel and Auto Workers they still have powerful labor organizations these days labor also includes education and health care as well as Baristas Tech workers and yes even comedy writers like me but even if your job is not related to a union you can still learn how to use Collective power in our own lives how to help us understand the common struggle for rights and protections for us all today's guest is Stanford political science Professor Margaret Levy here's a clip from her TED Talk Martin Luther King exhorted us to enrap ourselves in a single Garment of Destiny I have observed several unions that I've studied built expanded and inclusive communities of Fate In which large numbers of others recognize that their Destinies are entwined despite differences and distances this doesn't always happen but it can and it must we need as employees and citizens to build solidarity through communities of faith that crosses geographies and differences but to do that we need to re-imagine labor unions for now after this quick break we're going to reimagine what the new age of worker solidarity looks like so do not go anywhere you don't want to miss that [Music] okay welcome back on today's episode we are talking labor unions and the power of collective organizing hi I'm Margaret Levy and I'm professor of political science and Senior fellow at the center for democracy development and rule of law at Stanford University you know I obviously I want to talk to you specifically about unions but I'm also interested more broadly in how you started getting interested in inequality and solutions to inequality so it really goes back to the 1950s when I was a small child and my mother took my younger sister and I by the hand and we marched in civil rights marches in Baltimore Maryland where the inequalities were clear and rampant racially divided but also the divisions based on religion on nationality on class so early on and that was partially my father's influence as well I became very interested in class and the divisions that that perpetrated and that led ultimately to an interest in labor unions how have labor movements or organizing played a role in your own life I have not actually been a member of the Union because the the two places where I have been a faculty member unionization has not been has not occurred successfully I did try to organize a labor union when I was a teaching fellow as a graduate student we failed but boy we tried can I ask a question about that because I think that sometimes it's really presented as this kind of binary you win or you lose but do you feel like you gained something from the attempt to organize you oh my God yes absolutely you know I'm a political scientist I study Collective action problems I study power and boy did I learn a lot about how difficult Collective action is in part because of the variety of ways in which power can be exercised and some of them are not with a heavy Club but with a carrot what did you get out of that though like I mean other than the sense of like how hard it can be what were the victories that you feel like you took away from even a failed attempt at organizing there was a personal benefit of feeling much better about myself I mean I've done the right thing I tried hard I'm the kind of person who loves to learn so just that the learning experience about power and about its variety of forms enhanced my own work and research this is also my own bias but I feel like we undervalued the importance of just that feeling of solidarity of like listen we're all on the same side even if it doesn't end the fact that I have people who have my back yeah yeah so it's the solidarity which is a remarkable feeling and I felt that in those civil rights marches and in other things that I've done since I and I have been in other failed movements like the anti-war movement but still that feeling of solidarity is amazing but the other feeling that's also incredibly important is the feeling of self-respect the feeling of dignity that you get from engaging in an action because you know it's right and because you know it will help not just you if it does help you but will help other people as well other people who may not for a variety of reasons they have families they can't lose their jobs they can't do something they may be immigrants who are undocumented they can't engage in particular actions and put themselves at risk in that way so there's a feeling of rightness and goodness and self-empowerment by acting on behalf of others that I think should not be should not be underplayed for those of us who aren't as well versed in the history of labor unions where did labored unions really come from the start of the labor movement goes way way back depending on how you count it but if we think about the Contemporary labor movement it actually probably begins with the Navy and various kinds of mutinies that occurred in the Navy including in in relatively contemporary times early 19th century but the industrial unions is and the craft unions are really the beginning of the kind of unionization that I study the craft unions had their origins in the medieval guilds they developed uniquely in the 19th century in various countries U.S Germany Britain countries that were industrializing and they organized first and a way to train people to do the craft and to limit uh access to that particular occupation as a way both to ensure that the quality was high but also to ensure that the pay was high and that the working conditions were reasonable so that was a first kind of form of modern industrial unionization where the craft unions which ranged from cigar makers to construction workers to when electricity came in Electrical Workers The Long Shore workers or the Dock Workers who I have studied extensively were originally a craft unions the next stage was the Industrial unions or what we call the industrial unions which really organized all of the workers in a particular industry so all of the automobile workers all of the steel workers no matter what their particular skill or craft in the factory setting was and that was a very important form of unionization and those were very large scale and therefore extremely it led to some of the most militant actions that we think about in the history of unionization the big steel strikes in Pittsburgh in the turn of the century period and multiple big strikes that occurred the sit-down strikes in the 1930s in the automobile industry for example there's so much history here and we could do a whole podcast just on the the history but one of the things that I feel like comes up in maybe the pop culture understanding of unions especially recently is I I hear a lot of people saying like if you like the weekend Bank unions you know if you like working nine to five having those be your set hours think unions those kind of I think are the some of the real benefits that unions fought for that regular people have latched on to are those representative of the kind of Victories that you unions have made are those kind of outliers in a broader struggle they're very much part of the labor movement that is the kind of goal that unions had and it wasn't just for the members it was for most many unions many of the unions particularly the industrial unions were thinking about societal issues they were politicized unions who were trying to they helped win a social security they helped win us Health Care yes they did give us the weekend because they worked hard for a working week that had a period of rest attached to it so if unions are are so good for workers why is it that union membership has been in Decline well unions come with two disadvantages that have hurt them a lot I'll start with the ones that the unions create so what unions create for themselves has often been high dues that corrupt leadership may take advantage of if there is corrupt leadership so there have been unions which have been very problematic there have been unions which have been too bureaucratic that have been corrupt there have been racist unions as well as unions that have been committed to racial solidarity in which I include the Longshore workers and I include the teamsters which have had a long history of commitment uh cross they'll organize anything that moves so they don't care what color that person is so they've been very committed to that but some unions have not been you look at the history of the during the war in Vietnam in the U.S the unions and the left came into conflict after being in solidarity for so long so there were all kinds of things that the unions did that made them unpopular with some of their members and with much of the public but the biggest problem for unions is the kind of campaigns that have been waged against unions by government and by corporations not all governments are anti-union but an awful lot of governments have been in the history particularly of the U.S if you look at Union rates in other countries you'll see even in countries like Britain and Australia which have very similar kinds of constitutional arrangements and legal Arrangements that we do the union rate is is much higher in places like Sweden it's very very high the legal structure in the U.S has been very unfriendly to unions the National Labor Relations Act which was not superb but it was good and better and so much an improvement over what was preceded it that that's of almost 100 years old now we have not updated our laws in accordance with changes in the union we now have unions trying to organize and organized in the service sector and the gig sector in all kinds of sectors which aren't covered by the National Labor Relations Act so the laws have been against unions but the corporations and some governments have exercised extraordinary campaigns and put lots of money into fighting unions and creating bad PR for unions and making it hard for unions engaging often in illegal practices but it's hard because of the bureaucratic Machinery to adjust those things to stop them from engaging in those practices I certainly feel like in my lifetime the public perception of unionization and of the labor movement in general has changed quite a lot I think in the last couple years it seems like there's a lot more understanding of what a union does a lot more energy at least in my world of people thinking about what a just workplace would look like and thinking about how to achieve that I wonder is that just attributable to like the pandemic and forcing us all to look at Society in a big different way or or is it a force that's existed before the pandemic as well I think it existed before the pandemic it has certainly been Amplified by the pandemic if anything and brought the Public's attention to a whole set of workers that they weren't paying any attention to before those we are now calling essential workers the irony of how we for a short period of time called them essential and then have so rapidly seemed to decide that actually they're not essential if it means we have to treat them as essential I think that has been a real radicalizing Force for a lot of people myself included I think that's right so that's why I said the pandemic Amplified that that feeling so I think there was already a recognition that something had to change in the power relations between the employers and the employees whoever the employers were defined as because in the gig economy as we know that becomes a very complicated problem but certainly that there was a power relationship that needed to be corrected and improvements in the quality of work life and work compensation so that preceded the pandemic and there were already groups that were trying to rethink including the labor movement the traditional union movement itself trying to rethink its strategies of organizing remember there were attempts to reform labor law under Obama which preceded the pandemic I mean all kinds of service employees health care employees have organized in ways that were not and that's some of that's been relatively recent some of the the home care workers or mobilization has been relatively recent and quite large scale in terms of numbers a phrase that I've heard you use in talks and that I know you've used in a bunch of your books is communities of fate so not Faith but f-a-t-e can you explain to me why you find that to be a really crucial phrase when we're talking about these types of actions and movements absolutely so in a book that I wrote with John Alquist called in the interest of others which really looks at a series of unions that may be in some ways exceptional but also prove the possibility of this kind of organization what we discovered was that the unions that were able to mobilize their members beyond their narrow economic self-interest which is after all what unions are designed to meet those that were successful in doing so constructed what we called it and now call an expanded Community an inclusive community of faith not just a community of Fate but an expanded and inclusive community of Fate that really made people feel that their Destiny was linked to those often distant others who could would never reciprocate they felt like if it could happen to them it could happen to us we have to act now in order to prevent those kinds of abuses of human rights of well-being from continuing we're going to take a quick break and we will be right back with more from Margaret about the struggles and limitations of organizing what does solidarity look like when things do not go according to plan when things start going wrong we're gonna find out right after this [Music] [Music] and we are back union rates have been in serious Decline and at the same time an MIT survey revealed that 50 of the non-union Workforce would join a union if they were given the chance so why is that where's the mismatch coming from here's another clip from Margaret's TED Talk big read about the Amazon warehouse failed to win a union representation election in Alabama they failed because of concerted employer opposition indeed there are many employers and politicians who are preventing the reform of labor laws passed nearly a century ago in another era and another economy so Margaret on this show we're always trying to think about like how do you as a regular person how do you take these big ideas and these amazing theories and actually put them into practice and I think that something that is very powerful to me about unions is it can so often feel like the only way that these things could change if is if I was the person who owned the company is if somehow I was the boss then I could make things fair then people could be treated well but what can I do as just a regular person who's working here right I have no power I sometimes do work as a television writer and when I do television writing work I am in the writer's Guild of America and so right instantly I don't have to fight for it I'm instantly in the union and I find that I'm treated very differently in that work because there's a big Union that's quite powerful and so there's set rates and there's set protections and then when I go do something like stand up or like host a podcast I'm kind of on my own so for someone who isn't already working in an area that's been really heavily unionized which is most people how do you start to kind of Build That Power when it feels like well if I say no they'll just fire me and I can't afford to get fired I mean this has always confronted people who are trying to unionize right you know the the big moment in the sit-down strikes in the Ford plants in the General Motors plants in the Detroit area in the 1930s was when the Secretary of Labor Francis Perkins and the governor of Michigan decided not to not to call in the National Guard to put down the strike but rather to tell the National Guard to stand on the side and and to intervene if there was actual violence including by the corporation that was a big sea change I mean so imagine if you were in a world which we are a bit in but not as much as then where not only did you have to worry about how you were going to actually mobilize others and convince them to be part of it but where you had the huge Machinery of government and the corporate's private armies arrayed against you now luckily there are now organizations that are there to help most of them are available by going on the web they're things like unit that tell you how to organize get tell you the rules of the game will give you advice so there are organizations out there that can help including the traditional labor movement the AFL-CIO still provides assistance to those who are trying to organize those resources are in fact available and they're available in other parts of the world as well what advice do you have for someone who is fighting against that mindset of well this is bad and unfair and maybe even exploitative but if I don't do this work they're going to find someone else and I need this job It's Tricky that is tricky always tricky and that's where these organizations can help you know and publicity can help so if we look at the the cases of the Amazon warehouse workers for example or some of the Starbucks people and the kind of Retribution that they have been receiving it's now being somewhat rectified in part because of the publicity that so Howard Schultz had to change the processes and policies he was using where the stores that were unionizing weren't going to be treated worse than the stores that were the workers weren't going to be treated worse than the ones who weren't it's a campaign and it's an effort and there will be no question about it some people will end up losing they'll be the martyrs to the cause but the idea is to try to in prevent that martyrdom as much as possible to provide an environment of support in terms of mobilization of publics who can be supportive as well as using the laws and finding lawyers who will help to protect those who choose to organize it is a right it is in fact allowed to organize are there things that are very exciting for you when you think about the future of organizing and labor movements I think the most exciting organizing things that are going on are less about Labor and more around the environment I mean I am just in awestruck with what young people have been doing in terms of mobilizing other young people in all kinds of efforts to bring public awareness to how important the environmental question is and I think the unions could learn a lot from those environmental activists in terms of really speaking to where people are and addressing the kinds of questions that you're raising so I think there's a learning that could go the other way as well from and often social movements do learn from each other the labor movement helped the Civil Rights Movement the Civil Rights Movement taught the women's movement you know we learn from each other in social movement world I love that I think that's so crucial and important and you know we've talked a little bit about how you can get attention and publicity and how that can change things and how you know strikes are one way but also visibility and even just having an action that that draws attention can be another way of changing forces and changing situations do you think that things have really changed now that so many more people have access to media in the sense that like you can post a story online and everyone can see it it doesn't have to go through a newspaper or through some sort of powerful person is has that changed organizing for better or has that also made it more complicated because it can be buried by misinformation so how did you get information about unions in the past particularly when distances felt long and media was not so rapid you look at the stories that were written up in the traditional newspapers and which I've done at various times and they had no relationship to what's actually going on from the perspective that I know as someone who's looked at The Archives and the history people are changed The Narrative all the time so what one needs to do in this case as in any organizing case is to capture the narrative and to create a narrative that appeals to lots of people and that in some ways overwhelms The Narrative that is based on misinformation or on anti-union biases or whatever it is I'll come back to the Amazon workers and the Starbucks workers because they're some of the most recent and they're in the news these days they have really been capturing the narrative and that's been critical so they have really changed the view of what these unions are trying to do who they represent who the people are they're not allowing the corporations to tell the story um it seems like one of the things that I'm taking away from our conversation is that so many of the things that I believed about the labor movement or about unions are either half truths or outright not accurate and that there's so much of the history that is directly relevant to the situations that are arising today and that I really need to educate myself more about like where things have been so that I can see where things could go and how we can push them in the right direction how can we see what are the the most useful moments in history to look at for the future now or where we are in this current moment there are so many great books on labor history in in the U.S you know Nelson lichtenstein's state of the unions I'll give a call out to that it's a terrific book it's not up to the very moment but it gives you a sense of the important moments in the history of the American labor movement and there are a number of equally good books but the real issue is how do we draw from labor history when do we draw from labor history when is it relevant and I think it's relevant in the following sense one it's important for people to recognize what unions have done and what their absence does so the fact that unions were once so strong relatively meant that certain kinds of legislation got passed no not to everybody's taste I mean the the New Deal legislation is something that there's a whole movement against and we have governments that represent I mean presidents that represent that from Ronald Reagan on maybe even Nixon on so you know that's part of the history is that the unions gave us a lot uh but they also gave us a controversial lot things that there's at least part of the American public is very resistant to cease in a way that is problematic that the state is providing things that shouldn't or government is providing things that shouldn't be providing it also comes out of a collectivist tradition which you seem to be celebrating and I certainly do which is the idea that we are a large and expanded and inclusive community of faith in the best of all possible worlds and that we do have to act together and in solidarity to make things happen but America is grounded in a very individualist tradition as well which sees these kinds of things which bring us into solidarity as problematic because they may in some ways abridge our individual Freedom our individual liberty particularly when they get institutionalized into a union so both of those things are part of the history part of the history is what the unions have accomplished part of the history is who resisted the unions and why part of the history is what happens when the unions Decline and what we lose with that decline which is a whole lot of social protections and part of the history is who prefers that way of having the society organized what are the experiments what are new forms of unionization that that are developing now so what's happening in the warehouses and in places like Starbucks and in the economy is a whole different kind of organizing that's going on different ways and different strategies of organizing different ways of creating PR around what's happening different ways of mobilizing resources for those who are attempting to form labor organizations of different kinds and create worker voice and worker power so I think there are lots of experiments going on and some of them are beginning to be quite successful as we've seen some aren't so successful and that's you look at the history of unions and that's always the case the history of anything the history of government you know you try things they fail they succeed they partially succeed they have to be tweaked and that's what's happening right now and I think we have to you know one of the things that's also happening is rethinking what teachers unions look like what police unions look like what hospital workers unions look like so that they really are something that are serving not just those who are working there but also and not but but the general public and those particular kinds of consumers who need to use their services I I just want to add and acknowledge my own bias here because definitely the idea of unionization is one of the topics that I've changed my mind about the most in my adult life one of my first jobs was teaching at a public charter school that was not unionized and at the time I felt like that was a non-issue right I was pretty bought into the idea that the teachers union was a union that was protecting the worst employees from being fired I felt like as an organization they do not have students best interests at heart that was what I felt at the time and so I would say my opinion was like mostly neutral to negative but then the more that I learned about the history of unions the more that I saw what actually happens in the workplace as a whole not just on my little individual School the more that I started to really see the importance of a union and now I've kind of come all the way around to working in the entertainment industry and being actively involved in a strong powerful Union and it I guess it seems like many people have a somewhat similar experience to that where they work and as they work they're won over by the idea of unionization as they see the difficulty of holding any sort of line on Norms or pay or workplace standards alone as an individual how hard it is to make any sort of change just as one person so I'm curious one to get your reaction to that and two to know whether you think the best case scenario would be a world where everyone is unionized like do you want to see a hundred percent unionization or does that not really make sense I don't think it makes sense to be 100 unionization I do think what makes sense is to be a hundred percent covered by rules and regulations enforced by law that ensure that your work is compensated that you travel if you're forced to travel you are traveling under certain conditions I think you know the unions in some of those some of the stuff that you were describing unions are second best to a set of laws and rules and a state of the world that takes those things for granted for every person who enters the workforce right and the unions have been critical to that because they are a power base to make that happen so it's not just about your individual workplace it's about ensuring that those rules get put in place for everybody one of the things we haven't discussed is how the diversity of the labor force has changed when I talk about the industrial unions of the 1930s it's mostly white men right it's now black and white men it's now women it's now people of multiple backgrounds and with multiple skills and capacities we have all kinds of ways of predicting that diversity that are in law and all kinds of ways that we don't as we're seeing in the current legal regime so part of my advocacy of unions part of why I would like to see a higher percentage of people in unions is for its political power which will translate into economic changes but we need that political power to actually persuade those who in principle are representing us to take our interest to Heart and to ensure that our workers which includes almost all of us but not a hundred percent are in fact given the kind of treatment we deserve as contributing members of this society and final question for you what is something that has helped you to be a better human whether it is a book an idea a movie a piece of music a person could be anything what's one thing that's helped you to be a better human I actually think here I will turn to the labor movement being the Harry Bridges chair of Labor studies which I had the honor to be at the University of Washington brought me into close contact with the ilw the international Longshore and Warehouse Union what a remarkable set of people remarkable set of people they were the ones who taught me what it really means to build a community of fate and one that is inclusive and encompassing they just thinking about them brings tears to my eyes they put their money where their mouth was or their mouths where their money was both things they really um they developed beliefs about how important it was to act in the interest of others and they acted on those beliefs thank you so much Margaret it has been such a pleasure to talk to you I really appreciate you making the time to be on the show thank you Chris my pleasure that is our show for today

#TED #TEDTalks #renewableenergy","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'science', 'social change', 'future', 'activism', 'weather', 'Countdown', 'Kala Constantino']",2023-09-19T08:51:07-07:00,2023-09-19T08:51:07-07:00,Science & Technology,"Hello, everyone. I want to share a story of great change
underway in the Philippines, driven by the work
of many people like Nass. Nass is a dedicated policy expert
who has advised key government officials on the country's climate agenda. Now, Nass is leading hundreds
of climate leaders, mobilizing local governments and companies to shift to 100 percent renewable power. Because of their work last year, three companies and two city
governments have chosen to do so. Nass is not alone. Across the Philippines, thousands of people have come together to find effective ways to tackle
runaway climate change. These include policymakers,
scientists, young people, community leaders, small
and large business owners. They are breaking down the barriers
that stand in the way of cheaper and cleaner renewable power,
such as wind and solar. Because of this huge collective effort, I am now filled with hope that the Philippines is moving
towards an economy powered by the sun and the wind. My name is Kala Constantino
from the Tara Climate Foundation, and I am proud to know
and work with people like Nass who have made this
transformation possible. The Philippines has long depended
on imported coal and gas. Because of this, 114 million Filipinos pay
one of the highest electricity prices in Southeast Asia. But people want change. The Philippines is highly vulnerable
to the impacts of climate change, and we lose millions of dollars annually due to stronger
and more frequent typhoons. For us, climate change is real. We see it every year in the storms
that rampage through our communities, killing people, destroying
infrastructure and agriculture. We see the energy transition
as an opportunity to make our economy more resilient. Renewable energy can bring
in economic opportunities and create jobs in new industries. Scaling up wind, for example, could add 1.1 billion
dollars to our economy and create 80,000 new jobs over the lifespan of the wind farms. The Philippine government recognizes this, and it's increasing its ambition
for renewable power. Three years ago, the government
adopted a moratorium on building new coal-fired power plants. Since then, several Filipino banks
have adopted policies stopping the financing of coal
and funding more renewables. The new energy plan aims to have renewables
account for at least 35 percent of the power generation mix by 2030. This would not have been possible
without a diverse group of people committed to accelerate
the country's transition to renewables. Ian has spent 20 years
working with communities and vulnerable groups in cities
and towns across the Philippines, calling on the government to transition
to an inclusive economy powered by renewable energy. And Grace has spent 30 years promoting
renewables with local governments as well as with multilateral
development banks. Now she runs her own organization, building solar-powered plants
in small islands in the Philippines. Lawrence develops
innovative finance solutions to enable more private
investments into renewables as well as to retire coal plants early. They include a new generation
of young voices, too. Jeff analyzes and interprets
power systems sata to drive home the story
of why renewables are better, cleaner and cheaper. Avril is a young lawyer
proposing regulations that will accelerate
renewables deployment. Thanks to their efforts and the efforts of many
more people like them, the energy transition in the Philippines
is gaining momentum. But it isn't over yet. Operating coal plants still provide
47 percent of our electricity, and there are plans to build
seven new gas terminals. We need to transition away
from fossil fuels as quickly as possible. To keep moving forward, we need to continue working together to increase investments
for wind and solar, including offshore wind. We need to redraft regulations
that hinder the growth of this sector. We need to build a modernized and distributed electricity grid that will be able to absorb
and transmit more renewable energy. We need to ensure a just
and fair transition for workers and affected communities. A lot remains to be done before all Filipinos can benefit
from cheaper electricity, a cleaner environment,
a just and fair economy. And we will get there, hand in hand with energy
transition champions from around the world. Thank you."

#TED #TEDTalks","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'social change', 'activism', 'leadership', 'United States', 'violence', 'public health', 'government', 'gun violence']",2023-10-27T09:00:51-07:00,2023-10-27T09:00:51-07:00,Nonprofits & Activism,"In the blink of an eye,
life can change forever. One single moment can redefine
everything that we know and believe. In 2012, I would face the most devastating
moments of my life when my son, Jordan, was shot and killed
in a hate-driven shooting. My story, Jordan’s story,
had began as one of loss. But I refused to let it in there. A life of loss, a story of loss,
became one of transformation, of finding my voice and turning my pain into purpose. My story would become
my most important tool in fighting this nation's gun laws. Our personal stories have such power
to be able to bridge the deepest divisions and to inspire change
and to bring people together. After losing my son, I left
my 30-year career at Delta Airlines, and I began a new career as an activist fighting to change our nation's gun laws. And that trajectory led me
to winning a seat in Congress, which was once held by Newt Gingrich. I just have to say, though,
that everything that I have done, there was nothing more important to me
than being a mother. It all began with me
just wanting to simply be a mother. As a flight attendant, I had the ability to be able
to manipulate my schedule in such a way that I could be home for my son
every single night. And I have to be honest that dealing with all those
drunk passengers on the aircraft prepared me far better
for a career in Congress than it ever should have. But during the Great Recession, you know, Jordan and I had to find
fun activities that we could do that would not break my budget. So we spent a lot of time
in our local skating rink where you could get pizza
for a dollar a slice. And as Jordan got older
and he began to recognize girls, he would say, ""Mama, go over there
and skate with the adults. You go skate with them,
and let me skate by myself.” So off he would go,
trying to be so cool and so suave, and I would run up to him and I'm like, ""Oh, Jordan, my baby,
I love you, oh, my baby!"" And he would do everything that he could
to get away from his crazy mama. You know, Jordan and I
had just such a special bond, and it would be these intimate moments of our former life that would fuel
my new journey to Congress. A decade ago. Jordan was with his father
in Jacksonville, Florida, for Thanksgiving. And it was Black Friday,
the day after Thanksgiving, and Jordan was so excited because
he was going to go shopping with his boys. He was going to go shopping at the mall, and they were going to buy clothes
and pick up girls and just do all the things
that these teenagers would do when they're finding
their newfound independence. They stopped at a convenience store
gas station just to get some chewing gum. And Jordan was
in the back seat of the car, and a man pulls up next to them
on the passenger side. He starts complaining
about their loud music. And he starts a verbal
altercation with them, claiming that he couldn't
hear himself thinking. They needed to turn down
their “thug” music. He called them “gang bangers and thugs.” And in those three and a half minutes that man pulled a gun out of his glove box and he shot ten rounds into that car. Three of those rounds
hitting and killing my only son. And that's when I got the phone call. The phone call that is
the worst nightmare of every parent. And I remember Jordan's father
telling me that Jordan had been shot and my whole world went black. I had ... defined my whole life
as being Jordan’s mom. And in that single moment, being Jordan’s mom would take on
entirely new meaning for me. Grief, it traps you
in the prison of your own despair. And if we let grief take control, we risk losing not only our present
but our future as well. If I had succumbed to that loss, I would be enduring
not only one tragedy, but two. So I made a decision. I made the decision that Jordan's legacy
would not be one of loss, but one of hope. I chose to channel my pain into purpose. So I began my second career as an activist for Moms Demand Action, for Gun Sense in America
and Everytown for Gun Safety. While learning the unmistakable truth
that every single one of us is at risk to falling victim to gun violence. We all remember. Just a little over five months ago. A woman was killed
and four others were injured, just visiting the doctor's office, only about three and a half blocks
from here in midtown Atlanta. And a year ago, two were killed and three were injured
just down the street. Statistically, today,
120 Americans will be shot and killed and 200 more will be wounded. Per capita, the United States
has more gun violence than any other
developed nation in the world. And polling shows it. Over 80 percent of Americans agree that there needs to be some kind
of common-sense gun safety legislation, like universal background checks
for all gun sales. But why didn't I know about any of this before losing my son? Why was this country not screaming
at the top of its lungs for gun safety legislation? So I traveled this country
advocating for common sense laws, such as “red flag” laws that enable law enforcement,
along with our loved ones, to be able to take the guns
out of hands of people that are posing a risk
to themselves or to others. I've advocated for universal
background checks to keep firearms out
of the hands of convicted abusers. But by telling my story, I’ve been able to do something
that so many people talk about but they’re never able
to achieve in our politics: bridge the political divide. I'll never forget meeting a man
by the name of Reverend Rob Schenck. As an evangelical minister, he was the most prolific and leading voice in the fight against abortion rights through the 1990s. And as we begin building our friendship, I spoke with him at length about my need to save as many people's
lives as possible. We began to challenge one another, and slowly but surely, at great risk,
personally and professionally. he began to stand up. He began to stand up
as an activist for gun safety and, as importantly, also speaking out on pro choice policy. Our stories are bigger than our politics. And then in 2018, we all watched the horror
at a Parkland, Florida high school. And I heard all of our elected officials talk about, ""Oh, we need to make sure
that we change our dangerous gun laws. We need to make sure
that we prevent these mass shootings."" But they did absolutely nothing. And so I made the decision that if Congress was not willing
to change our gun laws, I was going to work to change Congress. So I ran for a seat
that nobody thought I was going to win. One of the incumbents in that seat
voted against the Voting Rights Act. I ran for a seat that was
once held by Newt Gingrich, and I heard all the reasons
why I could never win. I heard all the reasons,
such as, ""Oh, it was too political,"" and that I would never win
because it was unprecedented. And I even heard that I couldn't win
because I was a Black woman. So I took my story directly to the voters, and I told my story at their doorsteps, I told my story at their mailboxes, and I told my story by their telephones, and I won that election
by one percent of the vote. And in Congress I've heard all the stories
of why we can't address gun safety. They're pretty much the same reasons why people told me
I would never win my election. But I did what I've done
time and time again since I lost my son. I told my story. But in Congress,
I told my story to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. To date, I have passed legislation
such as “red flag” laws. I've supported legislation such as background checks
for all gun sales. And yes, I even had a hand in helping to encourage
this administration to create an Office
of Gun Violence Prevention. Telling my story has helped me
find meaning in my life again after losing my son Jordan. It's helped me find a way to Congress and to pass meaningful
gun safety legislation. The power of our stories is universal. And it lies within
each and every one of us. Never ever be afraid to tell yours."

He digs into the economic fallout of ditching fossil fuels and shows why unions are well-positioned to push the transition to clean energy and green jobs.

#TED #TEDTalks #unions","['TEDTalk', 'TEDTalks', 'TED Talk', 'TED Talks', 'TED', 'climate change', 'sustainability', 'business', 'activism', 'energy', 'work-life balance', 'Countdown', 'fossil fuels', 'Payton M. Wilkins']",2023-10-18T08:31:51-07:00,2023-10-18T08:31:51-07:00,Science & Technology,"Fossil fuels have got to go. We must put an end to these
climate-destructive, loosely regulated, dirty businesses
that are destroying the Earth. We've done the math, we have the data, and we know that these dirty businesses are making it increasingly
more uninhabitable on this planet. But when those jobs go away,
there'll be green jobs, right? Again, we've run the numbers,
we have the data and we know that the more we invest
in a green economy, the more jobs there’ll be: [more] healthier, higher-paying jobs
in the future than there are today. But here's the thing. People eat bread, not data. And when a corporation
shuts down a coal mine, as happy as some of us may be
about cleaner air, the reality is that people lose paychecks, they lose pensions, they lose jobs that they thought
were going to be there for their children. Schools close, small businesses shutter, and homes are lost. Poverty sets in. There are no green jobs
waiting for those folks. Shutting down a coal mine, a coal refinery
or most polluting facilities can devastate a community and a family. At the end of the day, I'm not so much a tree hugger
as I am a people hugger. And I don't really believe
in this dichotomy of jobs versus the environment. We can protect both. But we're not going to get it right
if we just helicopter in and tell people what's right. That's where unions come in. Unions for generations have been fighting
to protect workers' rights and justice. I grew up hearing people speak
about justice all the time. My mom started the first environmental
justice organization here in Detroit. Yes, Donele Wilkins, Detroiters
Working for Environmental Justice. (Applause) She started the first environmental
justice organization here in the city of Detroit, and yet, I still didn't truly understand
the intricacies of workers and the environmental movement until I was sitting offstage,
listening to a heated back and forth between a high-ranking member
of the United Mine Workers of America and a panel of climate experts
that I had assembled for the Coalition of Black Trade
Unionists's Annual Convention. On this panel, I had Cecil Corbin-Mark,
the late Cecil Corbin-Mark, deputy director of WE ACT,
an Environmental Justice Organization, based out of Harlem; Jackie Patterson, the founder and director
of the Shirley Chisholm Legacy Project, a climate justice resource hub; and Donele Wilkins,
CEO of Green Door Initiative, who also happens to be my mother. (Applause) I thought everything was going well. I thought that regardless of politics, we all kind of agreed that climate change
was a problem for human health, for our families, for our homes. So there I was, sitting in the first row,
Cecil was moderating, and then this high-ranking leader
from the United Mine Workers of America comes to the mic. And shit got heated. (Laughter) Like, really bad. I'm talking at this point,
I'm flushed red, sweat is beading down my face, and I'm thinking how best
to update my resume because they're not going to let me
keep my job after this shit. (Laughter) I look to my boss and he has
this look on his face that says, ""Get your ass on stage."" That's a lot to say in the book,
but I promise you this look said a lot. (Laughter) When the panel ended, my boss
pulled me aside and he said, ""You need to fix this."" So I quickly secured a room
to have a private conversation with the mineworkers and the panelists, and we listened. We heard the coal miners
talk about their desires, their fears, their legacies,
this dignity in their work. And we talked about the real reason
why the coal industry was dying, which had more to do with profitability
than it did with activists or policy. Coal is becoming more expensive while the cost of renewable
energy is falling. Investors are divesting from coal
because of its impact on the climate and the risk associated
with climate change. We all felt heard. We felt understood. The coal miners had opportunity
to separate the person from the problem. We talked about the history
of environmental justice and its roots in the labor movement. Since that day, and the months and years following, I started to see change
in the coal miners. They, for a long time,
have been actively [in] opposition to any types of climate policy. But now they're open to exploring taxes and emission standards
to regulate their industry. And while they aren't exactly
where I would like them to be, they have come a long way,
they've made progress. Unions have a long history
of keeping the needs and priorities of workers in their mind, protecting workers rights
and fighting for justice. In Memphis, 1968, a union of sanitation workers
went on strike after two African Americans
had been crushed in a malfunctioning garbage truck. That strike ended in April of 1968, when the city of Memphis agreed
to recognize their union and to meet the workers' demands. In South Africa in 1985, the Congress of South African
Trade Unionists quickly became the strongest
and most powerful union in South Africa by putting pressure on the apartheid
government through protests, boycotts and strikes that led to negotiations in 1990 and the end of apartheid in 1994. And in Denmark, when the country was transitioning
away from fossil fuels to wind energy, the union 3F negotiated
with the government and wind energy companies to secure jobs, retraining programs and fair wages. Those workers were equipped
to get employed in this new and growing
wind energy sector. Those workers were equipped. You know, the union movement is the only
multigenerational, multiethnic, multiracial, multigender
movement in the world. We're talking about tens
of millions of people united around a singular set of ideas. So it makes so much sense
that they're a part of this fight for a just transition. So how can we, those of us that are in the climate fight,
properly work with unions? It starts with deep listening
conversations, like the ones we had
at CBTU's annual convention. And workers and those who are pushing
for a green energy transition need to hear each other out. We need to hear each other's fears,
each other's desires, each other's ideas for the future. There needs to be
an education on both sides, one that allows us to learn
about the livelihood of workers and for all of us to learn
about the impact of the climate crisis. Since that conversation
that I had at CBTU, I started to actively invite
the coal miners to meetings and to the conferences that I attend
discussing just transition. My desire is for them to articulate
a path towards green jobs before negative profitability and policies
decides the fate for them. I want unions to secure federal dollars to aid in this transition
to retrain their members. I want them to realize
they don't have to choose between making a living and living
in a safe and healthy environment. They can have both. Hell, they deserve both. (Applause) I want them to realize
that they can live in a community that generates renewable energy, that they can live in a community
where they don't have to speculate what's in their water and their air. A community where people
are valued over pollution. I want them -- thank you. (Laughs) (Applause) I want them to realize that this isn't
some distant utopic future, but a reality that can be had
in a few short years. If the US government can bail out banks
and the auto industry, like they did in the financial
crisis of 2008, surely they can bail out
the American worker. (Applause) But I have a feeling
that this isn't going to happen without a concerted push from the unions. To transition to a green-energy economy, to protect our planet, we're going to have to make
some tough changes. But I'm a serial optimist, and I believe we can make this change
without too much pain. Thank you. (Applause)"

And I came upon a frog
that was flattened like a tortilla. (Laughter) And I was very sure
it was the ice cream truck that ran it over, that circled the neighborhood, playing the very dreary ""Cuckoo Waltz."" And it made a very big impression on me. A dead frog. I mean, tadpoles and salamanders and toads were practically family for me. And I had never understood
until that point that something could die. And I stressed about it. Tried to figure it out. What does it mean? I'd lie awake. And one night I heard
this beautiful sound, and I ran outside in my pajamas. And I looked up on the roof,
and there was a bird. And it was whistling and singing
and croaking and chirping and imitating crickets and crows and jays and frogs. And it was bouncing up and down its head,
bobbing, as if to say, ""I'm having the best and happiest
time in the whole world."" I looked up at it and I thought, ""I'm in the presence of God. And she's a bird. Who knew?"" (Laughter) And I was so happy with my discovery, I went back to bed and slept well. I got up in the morning
to tell my grandpa. And he said in his deadpan voice, he said, ""Son, that was just a mockingbird."" (Laughter) And -- But that mockingbird and that frog were life-changing for me because I realized, looking back, that from that point on, I devoted my life to restoring and protecting
the living world. And as I grew up in California, I was seeing nature
being dismembered weekly, and I wanted nature
in the driver's seat, not a roadkill. And I knew that she was the only one who had a valid
planetary driver's license. And that led to me starting
a natural food company when I was young. And I had read books about how Mesoamerican, Native American, Asian, West African farmers had developed regenerative
agricultural techniques to sustain and increase
the fertility of their soil for thousands of years. And that's when regeneration
became, for me, the lens and a framework with which I could understand
this relationship that we have not just to agricultural land but to the planet as a whole. And I went around the country searching for regenerative farmers and found some, and they were amazing. I sat at their feet. I learned so much. They understood the land like no one else, and they all understood
that soil health, plant health and human and animal health
were inseparable. Soil scientist extraordinaire
Jill Clapperton once said that when you're standing on the ground, you're standing on the roof
of another world. And that is so true. There is more life,
actually much more life, beneath than there is above the ground. And just last month, the paper came out describing
how soil fungi sequesters the equivalent of 13.2 billion tons of CO2, carbon dioxide, annually, which is comparable to 36 percent
of total fossil fuel global emissions. And yet we have an agricultural system that's doing everything it possibly can
to destroy fungi in the soil. It’s called plowing and tillage. It’s called herbicides:
dicamba, glyphosate, paraquat. Pesticides, neonicotinoids. I mean, fungicides. And I've come to see Big Ag and Big Food come to be the fossil food industry. The single greatest cause
of ecological degradation on the planet and the single greatest emitter
of greenhouse gases by any sector. Now the good news there
is that if we flip that narrative and it becomes regenerative, food and ag can become the greatest
contributors to reversing global warming. Regenerative farming
is fairly simple in concept. It means creating the conditions
for more life. So on a farm, soils flourish,
so do pollinators. So the birds, fungi, microbes, moisture, fertility, resilience. Regeneration is this nonstop mode of life. And life only exists in a cell. It exists nowhere else. And all 40 trillion cells
within each of you are regenerating right now,
this very second, as is all the microbial life
within you and within the soil. And what we know about the
[approximately] 8.7 million species that we share this planet with is that they all organize in community. And so whether it's a forest
or a forest floor, or whether it’s a family,
or whether it’s, you know, Fridays For Future, or whether it is a gaggle of geese,
or a pod of dolphins, or a locker room of the Detroit Lions, I mean, we are all the same. Communities and people, and soil, and life are this patchwork of living entities, teeming networks of exquisitely
interconnected organisms to which we owe our existence. Regeneration is not a panacea. It's not a certification,
it's not a standard. It is a pathway. It is a purpose. It is a direction. It means putting life at the center
of every act and decision, every policy and process. Regeneration restores forests, but also favelas, coral reefs and communities. Ponds -- beaver ponds, hopefully -- and the built environment. And it elicits and engenders localization, as contrasted to globalization. Ten thousands of NGOs,
of communities, of students, of activists, of foundations and companies are forging a regenerative
future as we speak. And they are addressing everything that we use, eat, buy,
make, wear and build. And thousands of Indigenous communities
and the First Peoples who have been treated
like the enemy for centuries, subjected to untold barbarity and cruelty, and who we have removed from the land that was theirs, where in some cases
they had lived continuously for over 40,000 years. And they are re-emerging and taking their rightful place as the progenitors of regenerative wisdom. And it's incumbent upon us to listen to these teachings
and these understandings. The mockingbirds where I grew up are gone. They're not there. The frogs, the tadpoles, the salamanders,
they're gone too. We humans have erased one half of all life on the planet in the last 200 years. This is biological chaos. Coupled, of course,
which you know very well, is climactic chaos. And they amplify each other. And if we're going
to reverse these crises, it requires one thing: reciprocity. Reciprocity means
giving more than you take. And when reciprocity prevails,
everyone benefits. And when it's absent, injustice prevails. And regeneration means listening intently and respectfully to all the voices, not just the human voices, and stitching together the connections that have
separated us from each other and from the natural world. The way you heal a system
is to connect more of it to itself, whether it's an ecosystem, your immune system or social system. When my daughter was two, I bundled her up and took her out to see the dazzling night winter sky, which she had never seen before. And she stared at it and then looked at me
with her big green eyes and said, ""Papa, papa, it’s the Moon and the stars. It’s the Moon and the stars.” She was looking at a miracle. And what I loved about her, she never assumed
that when we went out again at night that they would be there. And she was just as astonished
as she was the first time. And I think about her often because I think we presume that the mockingbirds and the monk seals and the hedgehogs and the elephants and the bumblebees and the redwoods and the dragonflies and the eagles will be there the next time for us and for our children. And that is no longer a given. (Bird chirping) It can only happen, it's only possible if we become regenerative cultural farmers in that we plant seeds of understanding in everything we do and wherever we go, and that we restore
and regenerate life on Earth. It's the only way. And this is why we gather. This is why we come together. We are right now this beautiful
direct expression of life. We are community. Thank you. (Applause)"
